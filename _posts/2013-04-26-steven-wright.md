> I was in a job interview and I opened a book and started reading. The guy said, "What the hell are you doing?" And I said, "Let me ask you this. Suppose you are in a space bus traveling at the speed of light, and you turn on the headlights--what happens?" He said, "How should I know?!" I said, "Forget it then, I don't want to work for you."
