I'm browsing on my iPad, the screen glitches, and suddenly, I'm in a videoconference.

"Sorry to interrupt," the attractive young man says, "But I'm doing some research on Early 21st Century Oppression, and I wonder if you could spare me a few... I think you called them minutes?"

There's something uncannilly "off" about his perfectly symmetrical face. And his English phrasing is off, like it's his second language. But I'm busy wondering how these damn survey people hack into my browser, and I'm looking for the DevTools menu instead of cutting him off.

"Did I say that correctly? Do you understand me? I haven't had any trouble with my Type II Standard English before," he says, flustered.

This is weird.



I decide to keep him on the line and figure out if it's a con or a prank.

"Where are you calling from?" I say, buying time.

He pauses, then says "Earth, of course, but I'm not supposed to talk about me, it taints the validity of your answers."

Earth, of course.

I am getting the feeling he's here to service my Swibble.

"What's the date is where you are," I ask. He doesn't hesitate. "2106, but nobody will believe you if you tell anyone I called."

"Yeah, well, that's my problem. Your problem is that I don't believe you, yet, and if I don't believe you, I won't answer your questions.

So.

Tell me something about the future."

He smiles. "Certainly, but let's stay on-subject. What yould you like to know?"

I get the feeling that it's a trap, he doesn't want to ask me questions, he's actually recoding which questions Inask.

Damn.

Double-damn, because prank or not, I have to ask, I need to ask.

"Do you still have racism?"

"Can you be more precise?"

And now I'm convinced he's profiling me based on my questions. But I'm hooked and I might as well jump i to the boat.

"Like biasing academic entry based on skin colour, or it being more difficult for black women to raise money than white men."

He shakes his head.

"I'm sorry, but that doesn't get fixed in your lifetime. But it does get fixed, and nobody on Earth is subject to that barbarity, and never will be again."

I'm depressed, but relieved. But I want more, and that's when I make the biggest mistake of my life,

I should hang up. I should quit while I'm ahead.

But no, I open my mouth and utter the word I'll regret forevermore: "How?"

"Oh!," he says airily, as if it's trivial.

"Everyone is genetically profiled from conception, there's no need for primitive superstitions based on skin colour or gender when your potential and behavioural profile are instantly available to every corporation and institution."

And now I realize that this struggle is just the prelude, and that the struggle to end all struggles is coming.
