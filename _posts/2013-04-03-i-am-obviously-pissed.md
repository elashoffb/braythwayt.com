> Apparently, women are sensitive, delicate creatures who must be shielded from coarse language lest they abandon their dreams of becoming a software developer and seek the shelter of being a stay-at-home-mom.â€”[some random internet troll](http://www.globalnerdy.com/2013/04/02/programmers-being-dicks-and-other-related-tales/#comments)

Hey sexist jerkwads, just stop that. It's a shit argument, and you ought to know better.

I won't let you call me a nigger in my presence. I won't let you spout any kind of vile, demeaning, racist crap. Am I a sensitive, delicate creature? No, and I'm not offended in the way you might think.

I'm offended that somehow your body grew into adulthood while your emotions stayed at 30 months of age. As Spock once said, "I object to you." He was talking about some God-like creature that acted without any moral compass. Just like you, except for the God-like powers thing.

Some things are just plain wrong. You claim you know about the difference between right and wrong, because you're constantly whining that it's wrong to deprive you of your right to say and do whatever you want.

I know all about that, I raise two children and I remember their time as toddlers vividly. Toddlers scream bloody murder when they're told that they aren't supposed to do whatever they want, whenever they want. Then they grew up and became sensitive to the whole living amongst fellow humans thing. They learned empathy and compassion.

In the 1950s, men did whatever they wanted and women had to put up with it. They also lived according to a strict set of rules about propriety that involved wearing a suit to work, cutting their hair, and so on. And no, they couldn't say whatever they liked. here were very strict rules about what kind of language was appropriate and what wasn't, where you could use a word like "whore" and where you couldn't.

Despite claims to the contrary, if you wore a tie to work you were not expected to make jokes about penises on the job. That was a blue-collar thing to do. Sexy pinups were acceptable at work, if you also wore a hard hat and/or got grease on any part of your clothing.

Now it's 2013, and you and your kind are trying to have it both ways, you greedy fucks. You want to insult and belittle people just like they did in the 1950s, but you also want to be free to wear whatever you want and say whatever you want in the workplace and/or at conferences where people are working.

There is no free lunch, and I am here to be the adult in your stinking playpen and tell you that. Now, either you invent a time machine and go back to that halcyon time where everyone feared atomic death from the skies, or you embrace the fact that times have changed.

We grew up and realized that with freedom, comes responsibility. You want to start going to the toilet by yourself and join us? Stop talking trash about people.

In fact, stop talking trash entirely. It isn't really about oppressed people as far as I'm concerned. It's about a professional environment, meaning we act like we are old enough to walk ourselves to school.

And that includes no longer saying girls are icky or any variation of same such as the one I quoted above. And it goes further. Don't talk about someone's library or language in terms that my eight year-old son would recognize from the playground. Engage in thoughtful criticism or buy yourself some diapers to hold your shit.

If you're an eight year-old, I absolve you of responsibility for comments like the above. But if you're nine or older, you are old enough to know better than to open your mouth and let your entrails run in reverse.

So just stop pretending this is about people being offended, or misandry, or reverse racism, or people with low IQs out-procreating you, or Apple Fanboys, or whatever you and your juvenile delinquent gang are trying to bully this week.

Just look in the mirror and imagine that you are an adult. Then start acting like one.
