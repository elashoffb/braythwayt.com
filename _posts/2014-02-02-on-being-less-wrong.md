I recently saw this news story circulating around some social media again:

> [Bill Nye Boo’d In Texas For Saying The Moon Reflects The Sun (Really???)](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/thepangeablog/2012/05/07/bill-nye-bood-in-texas-for-saying-the-moon-reflects-the-sun-really/)

> Bill Nye, the harmless children’s edu-tainer known as “The Science Guy,” managed to offend a select group of adults in Waco, Texas at a presentation, when he suggested that the moon does not emit light, but instead reflects the light of the sun.

> As even most elementary-school graduates know, the moon reflects the light of the sun but produces no light of its own.

> But don’t tell that to the good people of Waco, who were “visibly angered by what some perceived as irreverence,” according to the Waco Tribune.

The moon does not emit its own light in the way that the sun emits light, and suggestions that the light of the moon are a reflection of the light of the sun are entirely accurate. People who say otherwise are mistaken or disingenuous.

What I find troubling about this story is its legs. People seem to invest a lot of emotional energy in the ignorance of these Waco residents. Dare I say, people *delight* in making fun of them. It seems to me that it's a lot more productive thinking about light reflecting off a surface.

Physics fans will probably know where I'm going with this. Consider these beliefs:

1. That light travels in a straight line from the sun to the moon and from the moon to your eyes;
2. That light reflects off the surface of the moon;
3. That if we shine a narrow but powerful laser beam at the moon, the light of the laser reflects off a patch of moon the size of the beam;
4. That when light hits the moon, the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence.

They are all actually wrong. Not only does light not travel in a straight line, the word "travel" does not mean the same thing with respect to light that it does with respect to large-scale objects like spaceships and comets. The [double-slit experiment][slit] established that.

Light interacts with atoms in such a way that when photons interact with the atoms, other photons are released that we detect some time later, elsewhere. The photons appear to interact with some or many atoms whether those atoms are strictly speaking at the surface of a substance or deeper beneath it. In the case of a "transparent" material like glass, a single photon of light may be interacting with any molecule in the glass regardless of its position and depth. And light definitely does not interact with a small patch of a body it strikes. A diffraction grating proves this is the case, and so does a lens.

There are many texts for children, enthusiastic amateurs, and physicists going into detail about why all four things I said above are convenient approximations, but untrue. My favourite is [QED], transcripts from four Richard Feynmenn lectures wherein he explains how mirrors actually work.

The four beliefs above are wrong, but less wrong than the belief that the moon emits its own light.  What they have in common with other wrong belief is that if you profess "the truth," you receive the approval of your particular tribe.

In other words, for the purpose of demonstrating your fitness to belong to your tribe, the four wrong beliefs above are no better than the wrong belief that the moon emits its own light. Provided your beliefs match up with the tribe's beliefs, you can say "We're right, that other tribe is wrong."

If you *really* want to elevate yourself above people who believe that the moon emits its own light, you needn't go out and learn the state-of-the-art in [quantum electrodynamics]. That'll just move you to a different tribe, and you'll still have to argue with the [string theory] tribespeople.

To truly elevate yourself, you have to do something the people of Waco seem unable to do: You have to say, "This is what I believe, but while it's right enough for my purposes, it's probably wrong. Over time, we are always striving to learn more and evolve and grow as humankind and also personally."

In the end, it isn't being right that matters.

It's the willingness to be wrong.
