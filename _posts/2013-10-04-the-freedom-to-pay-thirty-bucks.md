Earlier this week, I made [JavaScript Allongé][ja] "Free as in Speech." It is now licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US).

[ja]: https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge

Because it is "Free as in Speech," it is *indirectly* possible to experience it being "Free as in Coffee:" someone who already has a copy of the book can share it under the new licensing terms with the proper attribution. If they don't charge any money for it, it will be "Free as in Coffee."

Notice that they are not *required* to give it away for free. Commercial use is expressly permitted. It is up to each person who shares the book to determine how to distribute it and what terms they wish to impose on their transactions, provided only that they follow the license terms.

By licensing the book thusly, I make it possible for it to be "Free as in Coffee," but that alone does not make the book "Free as in Coffee." It's just that some specific works--I call them "editions"--are free as in coffee.

In conjunction with LeanPub, I am making one specific edition free as in coffee, the version available [online][jar]. You can read that for free, and as it is covered by the license, you can print it to PDF, copy and paste it, and so forth.

In conjunction with GitHub, I am also making another edition available online, the [markdown source][s]. You can read this online, use your own tools to create a version in another format, or even fork the repo and write your own book using as much or as little of [JavaScript Allongé][ja] as you like.

So is JavaScript Allongé Free as in Coffee?

Not *pervasively*. In conjunction with LeanPub, I am still selling, for real money, an edition of [JavaScript Allongé][ja] in PDF, iBook, and Kindle formats. I ask you for thirty bucks to buy that edition from me.

### what costs thirty bucks?

Now let me be 100% crystal clear. I am not some marketing asshole working for MicroSoft and creating seven editions of Windows so that I can "segment the market" and engage in "price discrimination." All that stuff is based on deception. You really only have one copy of Windows, but you slap some labels on one of the boxes and charge twice as much as the other. Or you turn some features off and charge a little less.

To those people, sans some branding and segmentation, JavaScript Allongé is available without paying, therefore I am sending a "pricing signal" that it is worthless to me. That is scarcity thinking, and it is wrong.

In fact, JavaScript Allongé is *freely available*, but it's still worth thirty bucks in my mind, and that's why I ask for thirty bucks.

It's true that *You have alternatives to paying me thirty bucks.* You can read it for free, you can probably find it on a torrent somewhere, you can compile it to PDF yourself... The possibilities are multiplying even as I write these words. And if you choose to exercise one of those options, well, that's fine. If I didn't want that possibility to exist, I would have chosen a different license.

But you can also choose to pay. And every time a reader like you does business with me and chooses to pay even though they have an alternative, we see the real worth of the book to them. When you buy the book from me, you exercise freedom of choice. You weren't forced to buy it by ridiculous DRM that roots your computer. You weren't forced to buy it by threat of a long prison term for "circumventing DRM." You weren't forced to buy it by a license term prohibiting your from obtaining it elsewhere.

That's a beautiful thing for me and a beautiful thing for you. I mean, don't buy it just because I said it is beautiful, but if you do, then take pride and satisfaction in making your own choice, without duress or compulsion.

I talk a lot about freedom in other contexts. The freedom to choose to pay money is an important freedom too. When we make that conscious choice, without duress or fear or necessity created by artificial scarcity, I believe we are operating on a higher moral plane than when we buy and sell what amount to long strings of 1s and 0s with lawyers dangling from them.

> The freedom to choose to pay is meaningless without the freedom to choose not to pay

This is why I make choosing not to pay possible and urge you to choose without feeling guilty. I've already achieved what I wanted to achieve. If I never get another cent, that's fine. You are completely free to decide what it's worth to you, for *your* reasons.

So I am choosing to ask for thirty bucks, that is what I think it is worth, and these are the reasons why I make it available in other ways even though I still think it's worth thirty bucks. If my reasons line up with your reasons, let's do business.
