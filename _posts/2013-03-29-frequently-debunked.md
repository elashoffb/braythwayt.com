> When you jump to the defence of women, you're reinforcing the patriarchy by presuming they're weak and need a man to speak for them.

I don't jump to the defence of women or anyone else, I jump to *my* defence. I find certain behaviours noxious and/or unbecoming of the society or group I am invested in, and therefore I act alone and of my own accord for what I believe is in everybody's best interests.

When you imply that I'm doing it for "them," you're also implying that there's an us and a them. I reject that. You're implying that there isn't any of my own self-interest in change. I reject that too.

> I agree in principle with the need for change, but so-and-so is a terrible poster-child for the role of an aggrieved victim.

Consider a police officer who beats a suspect. Is it important whether the suspect committed the crime? It is when you're a demagogue seeking election or karma on Reddit. It is not only unimportant when you're seeking justice, it actually goes the other way. True justice is when we give the guilty a fair trial even though we think they did it. True justice is when we think that society as a whole is better off for being just, rather than thinking that justice is a mechanism for filtering the good apples form the bad.

I don't care who so-and-so is. I care how we respond to the circumstances.

> So-and-so was over-reacting, I don't believe they were offended, and if they were, they shouldn't have been.

Irrelevant. If you use the word "nigger" in my presence, I am highly likely to speak up. I am not threatened by the word. I am not offended. I will not be angry. I do not feel oppressed. I simply do not want the word used in my or anybody else's presence.

I spoke up to a good, dear friend when he used the word "Paki." I assure you, I do not take that word personally in any way, shape or form. But I also have strong feelings about the use of the word, and that's that.

If a person of colour, or a woman, or a queer person, or anybody else speaks out about words or behaviour that we nowadays call "Offensive," we needn't argue whether they personally got all hot and bothered about it in an emotional sense. The behaviour is wrong and they happen to be the one speaking out about it today. Tomorrow it might be me.

If you want to say that they "have an agenda," bingo. So do I. It's called *change*. Our agenda is to change the world. You're right about that.

> I didn't mean it that way

Good! So now you know it's not cool, and since you harbour no ill will, it's a simple thing to avoid that in the future. Let's call it a misunderstanding and move on. Only an irrational zealot would not mean any harm but insist on being harmful.

To be perfectly candid, I don't give a damn what you meant. That's your business. I am not your confessor or your shrink, I am a stranger and in no position to lecture you on what should go on between your ears.

My interest is in what you say or do, and as long as you don't do that thing again, we're cool. So you don't really need to convince me that you didn't mean to disrespect me with talk about black people and IQ, or that Ford didn't mean to disrespect women with mocked-up ads featuring bound females in the trunk of a car.

Just stop that and let's move on. No explanation required.

> We shouldn't have to change just because it bothers you.

"Should" is a question for you to take up with your God or Gods. I don't have the patience for arguing how the world ought to be. Right now, the world is such that me and a bunch of other people are not going to tolerate that shit any more. You obviously have no problem trying to get us to change the way we behave with your blog posts and your whining about how downtrodden you feel, so don't even try to dissuade me from my course of action.

Just be prepared to hear about it if you keep up the horseshit behaviour.
