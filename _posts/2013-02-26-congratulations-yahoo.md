Yes, congratulations on issuing the edict (or is it decree?) that *Henceforth, all such persons who attempt to further Yahoo!'s mission and business goals but who fail to do so within such times and places as dictated by Yahoo! management, shall suffer the penalty of walking the plank.* In other words, "Have your ass in an office chair, in our offices, during office hours, or you're gone."[^rumour]

[^rumour]: Rumour has it that this is a "soft layoff," and that many of the people who comply with the edict and start working from the office will soon be fired any ways, but that's just a rumour.

This has attracted some ridicule from people who have a successful track record either working remotely or managing remote contributors. Why, they want to know, would Yahoo head back towards the workplace of 1953 when the rest of the world is living in 2013? And what effect, they ask, will this have on top producers who prefer to work from home?

These critics are very smart people and I admire them greatly, but I must gently ask them: What experience do you have running a ship that lost its rudder years ago and is so waterlogged that half the crew are too busy bailing water to sail the thing?

What experience do you have managing a crew of people that has already been hit by layoffs, that has been demoralized by a constant stream of stories about its management's ineptitude and generous pay packages? How do you know that the top producers who haven't already walked out the door aren't now extremely loyal and/or terrified of looking for work elsewhere?

I think it's a perfectly sensible thing for many companies to hire remote workers. I also think that Yahoo may be doing a sensible thing in cutting them loose. What works for a small, nimble yacht may not work for a lumbering supertanker that catches fire with a leeward reef. And if the Captain of the Ship needs to yell for everyone to drop their work and rush to fire stations, that's precisely what she should do.

Good luck, Yahoo!
