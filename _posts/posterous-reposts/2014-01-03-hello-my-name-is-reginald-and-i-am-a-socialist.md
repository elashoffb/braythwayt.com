Recently, someone expressed surprise that a regular contributor to Hacker News might be opposed to Capitalism.

Well, I (somewhat [erroneously](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism)) self-identify as a little-s socialist. Yeah, I get that Big S Socialism is Communist Russia. I also get that the USA is little-c capitalism, since its markets are very imperfectly free. Things like patent laws and never-ending Disney copyright extensions exist to make the markets inefficient so that monopolists can tax customers instead of exchanging goods or services for money at true market equilibrium.

But I don't want to have that coffee-house argument where we spend all our time arguing definitions. The thing is, I am what you might call a "local" rather than a "global" Socialist. I doubt full-on Socialism would work in Canada, but I like the idea of workers forming self-organized collectives.

> Socialists advocate a method of compensation based on individual merit or the amount of labour one contributes to society. They generally share the view that capitalism unfairly concentrates power and wealth within a small segment of society that controls capital and derives its wealth through a system of exploitation. They argue that this creates an unequal society that fails to provide equal opportunities for everyone to maximize their potential.

I have no idea if the folks laid off from auto-makers want to do that, but I do know that I and many of the programmers I know seem happy with the idea of working in small teams in a collaborative and egalitarian manner rather than having a command-and-control approach to doing things.

I don't like the idea of anyone forcing me to accept socialism, but I know that if you don't call it socialism, lots of people I admire voluntarily contribute to the collective community good through open source.

I get that what I like doesn't "work" in the sense that it isn't a universal prescription for making everyone in society happier. I get that the things I like are susceptible to being "gamed" much as North American "capitalism" is constantly being gamed. But given a sufficiently small sphere of concern and sphere of influence, I can enjoy what I like. Maybe most people want a boss telling them what to do and don't care whether what they produce is any good. I can't tell them to live their lives a different way. But I don't need everyone to buy into that. I just have to wander around until I find like-minded people in a start-up or a [software development group](http://unspace.ca) or [an espresso bar with free wifi](http://darkhorseespresso.com/).

> Libertarian socialists (including social anarchists and libertarian Marxists) reject state control and ownership of the economy altogether, and advocate direct collective ownership of the means of production via co-operative workers' councils and workplace democracy.

I know that many startups are launched expressly to make their founders stinking rich. And I'm ok with that. I also know that many startups are launched because the founders prefer to work around the clock on something they love without a boss telling them to come on in on Saturday. That isn't socialism, but boy does it feel like workers being more efficient when they seize the means of production---the compiler---rather than being coerced or exploited.

So just as 2 + 2 = 5 for sufficiently generous values of 2, I am a little-s socialist for sufficiently Libertarian values of "socialism." I cheer whenever a group of people get together and make something of value, whether they do it to flip a company into Google or whether they do it because it just had to be done.

My name is Reginald. And yes, I am a socialist.
