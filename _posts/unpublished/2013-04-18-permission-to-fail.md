TDD is overhyped.

Rails is overhyped.

There is no right way to develop software.

The adherents of SOLID are following dogma.

Asking puzzle questions in an interview is wrong.

Asking programmers to code in an interview is wrong.

All of these things have something in common. They are statements that there is no reproducible method for success in software. The "Right thing to do" is always some vague combination of "Experience," and "knowing when to follow the rules and when to break them," and "Be guided by best practices but not bound by them," and many, many variations of the same thing.

You can say, "Hire smart people," but we don't even know how to hire smart people. That is, we have no reproducible way of selecting smart people. Every single thing you can say about how to hire smart people will be met by a chorus of boos.

And what is a "Smart person?" The only way we have of deciding whether someone is smart is *post facto*, if they did smart things after the fact.

You know what an empirical science is? One where we can make a falsifiable prediction. A falsifiable prediction would look like this:

* "If you slavishly adhere to TDD, you will fail."
* "You cannot scale a site out to 1,000,000 requests per hour using PHP."
* "If you demand that every hire write this ten-question C++ test, you will be unable to fill your engineering positions with qualified people."

Everything else is, well, just as empty a statement as saying that TDD is Doing The Right Thing. The falsifiable prediction is:

* "If you slavishly adhere to TDD, you will succeed."

When I see two people shouting empty, feel-good slogans past other, I know I'm looking at a contest in *rhetoric*, not an argument. They are not trying to advance the state of our thinking, they're trying to get click-throughs or retweets, or applause, or upvotes on Hacker News, or whatever.

And let's be clear about how this rhetoric works. If you say that "X is bad," everyone doing X feels insulted and/or threatened. try saying *anything* about how to hire programmers that is objective. You will get huge pushback from people who feel that they would be a false negative.

And if you say, "Y is good," the people doing "X" will assume you mean that they're DOing It Wrong. Same pushback.

Honestly, what does it mean to say that following TDD is cargo culting? It means "Hey, I don't like TDD and I read this article that gives me permission not to use it." Well, newsflash: You didn't need permission not to use it in the first place.

If you work in a TDD shop, what are your chances that passing the article around will get everyone to say, "Wow, we didn't know that this thing we're doing that seems to work is actually full of shit."

I'm not saying TDD is good, or asking people how to weigh rocks is crap, or anything else. But I am saying that if we aren't coming up with falsifiable predictions, we're just giving people permission to do what they already want to do.

Convincing people not to change is a pretty low bar to clear. We can do better.
