I am easy to distract when I'm writing. I've tried "distraction-free" writing applications, but they don't help me much. What *does* help me is simplifying the medium, not the tool. I discovered Markdown four or five years ago, and it transformed my writing for the better.

As you probably know, Markdown is a text markup language invented by John Gruber to be efficient for writers to write. It is deliberately minimal and designed to resemble the text-only conventions of old-school emails and newsgroups. So you use things like `*italics*` for *italics* and `**bold**` for **bold**. 

Personally, I think the direct correspondence with email conventions is a selling feature but not necessarily a *using* feature. It might, for example, be even faster to put a single `*` in front of a word for bold instead of bracketing it. But that is beside the point. Markdown is fast enough.

### limited choice

More importantly, Markdown offers **limited choice**.

There are only so many things you can do with a pure Markdown document. Technically, you can embed HTML in a document. So if your environment supports it, you can embed iframes, center text, and rotate it with webkit-specific CSS. But if you pretend that HTML doesn't exist, you write, and then when you've written, you're done.

You can't procrastinate publishing while you cycle endlessly looking for the exact right combination of typefaces and background colours that match the mood of your writing. You get what you get and then you're done. No analysis paralysis. No endless polishing, unless you're polishing your words.

Markdown helps me write because it throws overboard a bunch of stuff that is about styling words but isn't about writing words. That's a beautiful thing. It strongly reminds me of Zed Shaw's [Programming, Motherf-----][mf] manifesto. Markdown is about Writing, Motherf-----!

### crippleware vs dramatic simplification

Sometimes, tools are limited "just because." Microsoft used to peddle a low-end word processor called [Write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Write). On the Macintosh, it was obvious that they were executing a "segmentation" strategy with the product. They deliberately limited its capabilities and charged less, the idea being that anyone who wanted more would need to spend the extra bucks and buy Word.

The end product wasn't dramatically simpler than Word. It had fewer features, but they didn't really translate into a dramatically less complicated product. Fewer features isn't automatically "simpler," it's just "smaller." I liken it to an automobile. A luxury car may have many, many more features than a less expensive car, but nevertheless it isn't dramatically simpler to drive the less expensive car. It just has fewer gee gaws.

If you want to really simplify a car, you have to do something dramatic to disrupt the driving experience. Like a [driverless car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_driverless_car). Simply removing features won't get the job done.

This principle is one of my personal beliefs. I apply it to all kinds of things, from programming languages to living in a small, converted cottage. You cannot simply remove things and end up with a simpler experience. You must design around simplicity in a dramatic, disruptive fashion.

When you do, you can end up with *more*, not less.

### dramatically simplified computers

People have been working on dramatically simplifying computers since the 1960s. That's fifty full years ago. We've had [Xerox Parc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)), the [MIT Media Lab](http://www.media.mit.edu), and countless private ventures.

Today's "pure" tablets like the Apple iPad have made the biggest strides towards dramatically simplifying
