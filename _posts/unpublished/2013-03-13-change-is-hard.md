It's easy--very easy--to dismiss simpler, "cut down" products as being trivial. And they usually are trivial and absolutely no threat to the 800 pound gorillas in any market. Even if you're sincerely trying to evaluate a new product, it's hard to look at it for what it is and not judge it in comparison to what you already know and love.

### ipad vs. macbook air

I love my 11" Macbook Air. After hefting it and carrying it around in my shoulder bag, I find Macbook Pros to be clunky. And when their fans start up, I don't care how many cores are running my Jasmine specs, I feel irritated. It's a great computer.

I also have an iPad. I bought one the first few minutes they were available to be ordered. We now have Retina iPads that are wicked fast in comparison. I like my iPad and I think it's a real revolution. I've even used it to program with Dropbox, a bluetooth keyboard and an ssh client to a remote system for staging my server code.

But my iPad is not that much lighter than a Macbook Air, and it has a terrible pen interface, so I never got addicted to writing on it with a capacitive stylus the way I became addicted to writing with my old Toshiba Portegé Tablet PC.

I like the iPad for what it is, the greatest web browser I've ever used. And as a bonus, it runs all these other handy apps as well. But has never been a replacement for most of the things I do on my Macbook Air.

There are some things it does better. And many critical things it does worse. And it isn't better enough to replace the Air, nor does it offer compelling alternate way (pen interface, for example) to do the things that the Air does better.

### enter the iPad mini

I recently had a short-lived experience working in a medium where it was important to preview my work on an iPad. My iPad is slow and doesn't represent the current generation of iPad experience, so I bought an iPad Mini. I could have bought a retina iPad, but why get more of the same? As a bonus, I figured, it would be a better device for watching movies and TV shows in bed with Air Video.

I got a lot more than I bargained for.

The iPad Mini is smaller and therefore much more portable than either the Air or the iPad. There's a tipping point of sorts, when a device gets small enough that you start carrying it even when you don't plan on using it, "just in case." Phone cameras are like that, at a certain point they're good enough that you use the phone instead of a camera because it's good enough and you always have it handy.

My iPad Mini is good enough for a bunch of things I'm used to doing on my Macbook Air. And I can carry it around with ease. Its battery lasts forever,[^apple] I can use it without recharging on a transatlantic flight. And in fact, I did use it both ways to Københaven and then again both ways to München.

But is it *better* than an iPad? And more importantly, is it better than a Macbook Air?

### digression: programming languages

I find that although I talk a big line about learning on my blog, in reality I can be conservative about new tools. I need to immerse myself in something to grasp it. With the iPad Mini, I needed to immerse myself to appreciate how to use it properly.

With a new programming language, it's usually a terrible idea to do something you've always done, the way you've always done it. You walk away saying, "JavaScript is a terrible implementation of Ruby. It just doesn't get Objects, Classes, Modules, Eigenclasses, &c. &c."

And why shouldn't you say this? Ruby provides something live seven different ways to make four distinct things that look like functions: Procs, Lambdas, Unbound Methods, and Bound Methods.

JavaScript, the idiot savant of the programming world, just has one kind of function and you use them for everything, even constructing new objects. JavaScript functions seem underpowered in comparison to Ruby's phalanx of objects and classes, like a [Citroen 2CV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citroën_2CV) in comparison to an [Avro Arrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Canada_CF-105_Arrow).

And yet, if you embrace JavaScript's simpler way of doing things, you find it's a fine language with many positive things to recommend it. Using prototypes instead of traditional classes works with the language's simplicity instead of against it.

And thus when learning something new, just like learning a new language, you have to break through trying to do the old thing with the new tool and learn what the new thing is that the new tool's strength affords.

### back to ipad mini

So I buckled down and decided I would do a substantial piece of work on the iPad, and that when something seemed awkward, instead of cursing it, I would try to do things differently and learn to use the iPad in a more natural way that was aligned with what it did well and encouraged.

I recently tried an experiment: I composed and edited my wroc_love.rb presentation entirely on the iPad. I disciplined myself to eschew the Air at all times. If something was awkward to do, I swore I simply wouldn't do it.

### learning a new thing

The question I wanted to answer wasn't "Can it be done," but rather, "Can it be a *better* experience due to its unique format?"

I now can answer, yes, it can be a better experience. Not just because the iPad is right there whenever I have an idea, but also because the direct manipulation of my fingers suits a slide metaphor. I don't think I can say the same thing about writing a book yet, but there is a real "click" between working on a touch screen and working with slides. It feels right.

The wroc_love presentation went well, and I decided I would do it all over again for Web Rebels 2013.

### haiku deck

I grabbed a copy of [Haiku Deck](http://www.haikudeck.com), a presentation app written *specifically* for the iPad. It is very opinionated: It only makes a certain type of presentation, and you have a very limited palette of options available.

![I have no idea what I'm talking about](/assets/images/i-have-no-idea.png)

But within its primary use case, it is very well designed and again it feels really right. And although you can export presentations in other formats, it is most at home right on the iPad or publishing your work directly to the web from within the app. Like this:

That feels like the future, editing things and publishing them to the web. Sending someone a file in an email feels so very *last century* to me.
