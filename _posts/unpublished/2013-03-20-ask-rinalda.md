*Today I have invited a guest, the legendary "Rinalda," to pen a column. She is the host of her own Pirate Satellite Radio Call-In Show, and in response to my plea to explain appropriate and inappropriate workplace and conference behaviour, she forwarded transcripts of some of the questions she has answered over the years.*

### Rinalda, I'm attracted to a colleague and I'm pretty sure she's attracted to me. I'd like to proposition her. What kind of line can I use without running afoul of the PC zealots?

Caller, my suggestion is to write down three different lines and then take them to your manager.
