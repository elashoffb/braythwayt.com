An oft-quoted maxim is to never design for yourself: You aren't representative of your market, therefore you'll design a product only programmers could love, and so on.

I have observed a large number of product design failures, and I'm going to go out on a limb and disagree with this one. I have seen people "design for themselves" and do well. I have also seen people design for themselves and fail, not with a bang but a whimper.

My suggestion is that the failures aren't failures of doing a good job of designing for the wrong person. They're failures of doing a shitty-ass job of designing for "themselves." Good design is hard. The problem of programmers being shitty designers in average isn't caused by the fact that programmers have different needs than "ordinary people," the problem is that **design is hard**.

And lest you want to argue, I suggest you peruse Github. Look at all the libraries and tools designed by programmers for programmers. How many are well-designed? I thought you'd come around to my point of view. If programmers on average had any talent designing for themselves, we'd all be paralyzed with the delight of having so many awesome libraries to choose from, when in fact we hate nearly everything we see.

And we programmers are not alone in the Universe! What about when businesspeople design business software? They are the users, and they *still* do a shitty-ass job! Nobody with a few years of consulting experience will claim that the users of business software are magic experts at the design of business software. *The secret is that very few people are any good at designing software*.

Why?

Well, half the problem is the attitude suggested by the maxim not to design for yourself. The implication is that if you were the user, you'd do a fine job. That attitude *totally disrespects* the skill of design. It insults us by telling us we're shitty-ass designers while simultaneously insulting everyone who's good at design by implying that they're good at it because they know what users want.

The moment you accept that design is hard, you can stop worrying about whether you should or shouldn't design for yourself. Solve the hard problem--good design--and the easy problem of selling whatever you design will follow.

If you are one of the few who are already good at design, **go ahead and design for whomever you want**. If you create a well-designed product that meets your own distinctive needs, I bet other people would rather wrap their heads around a well-designed problem than wrap a poorly designed product around their heads.

But let's be clear: The hard problem isn't sorting out what needs the market has. The hard problem is designing good software to meet *any* set of needs whether yours or anyone else's.

And if you are a shitty designer, as I am? Don't sweat it. **Design is a learnable skill**. Go out and invest 10,000 hours in becoming a great designer. Don't assume some people have it from birth. Just recognize that the hard problem is good design and treat it like every other hard problem you've already conquered.

Good luck! I'm looking forward to seeing what you create.
