![No whining](/assets/images/no-whining.jpg)

I am, of course, a self-made programmer. I did it, and therefore you can do it. No whining, no complaining about not getting the right start in life.

My [mother] was a systems analyst in the 1960s when most other people's mothers were homemakers.

I played with physical core memory, keypunches, punch tape, and teletype machines before I was ten. I went to a private school called The International School of Ibadan, where the teachers and students valued education and accomplishment in the maths and sciences.

In 1972 or so, I was back in Toronto, where I went to a special program for gifted children on week-ends. There I was exposed to abstract math and game ideas like playing tic-tac-toe and go-moku in three and even four dimensions.

I was also introduced to UofT's high-speed job stream and shown how to run programs in WATFIV and SNOBOL. In exchange for running errands, I was able to play around with APL.

I later went to an expensive and exclusive private school, St. Andrews College, where I had access to a minicomputer. I learned to bootstrap the machine by toggling instructions into the CPU. I also learned to write games in BASIC, like a program that played the Maharajah variant of chess, Super Star Trek, and an eight queens solver. At the time, most other high school students in Ontario didn't have any computer programming instruction or exposure at all.

My roommate at St. Andrews was an intelligent young man named Mike. He's now "Dr. Mike," as in Doctorate in Physics. We used the school's laser to try to measure the speed of light.

Back at home, my mother owned her own real estate business. She bought an IBM PC and naturally, I had access to it. I played with TI-SCHEME and the GEM environment.

You can take one look at my experience and see that if I can do it, you can do it, and if you aren't doing it, it's your fault. Environment has nothing to do with accomplishment.
