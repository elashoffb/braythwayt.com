Dear Sirs:

We in the developer community have noticed that you have employed a person or persons with the title "Developer Evangelist" and/or "Public Relations." We understand this person't duty is to represent your products and services in a positive light to our community.

In the past, companies like your have mishandled this crucial role, so we are reaching out to explain our "Code of Conduct Keys" or "CoCK." Following these keys will guarantee smooth, uninterrupted relations with the developer community:

**Key**: While we support the right of all persons, whether coloured, gay, or female, to speak up and report any harassment or inappropriate conduct in theory, *in practice* this is a distraction to their job as your representative and any consequences or mistakes that may be made--by any person--as a result of their actions reflect unfavourably on YOU.

Consider telling them to restrict their activities in persona and on social media to representing you in a positive light and nothing else. They work for you, remember? They aren't supposed to be trying to change society on your dime.

**Key**: We like having females in these roles--preferably young and attractive ones--because we're mostly men and that's just biology, not sexism. You're in business, consider that carefully when choosing the person to represent your company. There's nothing wrong with taking our wishes into account for the purpose of making money, that's just economics, not morality. And keep in mind the first key. We like them to be female, provided they let us do the talking.

**Key**: Should one of your representatives annoy a small but vocal minority of developer representatives, keep in mind that they will never let the Internet forget it. She will be effectively barred for life from working in this industry in any capacity, or so we will make it seem. Further, we will represent that anyone who hires her in any capacity will be obviously hostile to the developer community. That's how we roll in a meritocracy. We merit our position of power, she merits our revenge, for life. Of course, we will always portray it as a case of a poisoned well, we will never admit to being personally involved, it's just logic that she can't do her job any more, right?

If you have any questions about the CoCK, please do have one of your people blog or tweet about it. You can count on us to respond swiftly and forcefully.

Pseudo-Anonymously Yours,
