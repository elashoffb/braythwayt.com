title: Facebook Advertising's Dis-Service

Well, *that* was quick. 24h after I started advertising my book on Facebook, I'm calling it off. The reason being, Facebook's automated customer dis-service.

![Email from Facebook](http://i.minus.com/ibd4cIUMinR6iz.png)

I received an email from Facebook notifying me that my ad for [JavaScript Allong√©](https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix) violated their terms of service. It has text covering more than 20% of the image, and that's a no-no. I get the general reason why, text in an image could be used to circumvent spam-filtering.

Of course, the image in my ad was the cover of the book, and the text in question is the title of the book. Not spam. And clearly, no human looked at this ad before canceling it. So, I guess I need to speak to a human if I want to keep spending money.

Of course, responding to the email is forbidden, it's a send-only account. That would be too easy for me, the paying advertiser. But not to worry, the email provided a link I could click to contact them and resolve the matter. That leads to a form:

Notice: I need to tell them who I am, my Facebook email address, some link to my ad, and the text of the email. Why don't they know all of this stuff? They sent ME the email, they can and should pre-populate all of this stuff in the form.

But no, I have to go to my ads center and figure out the email for the ad. I have to figure out this "Facebook email address" that I never use. And no, I couldn't find it. Silly me, clearly [PBKAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEBKAC#Acronyms_and_other_names_for_a_user_error).

But speaking of artificial intelligence, if I give them the ad url, are they seriously telling me that they can't figure out who placed the ad and how to contact them? If they give me the form url, they can't sort out how to do that while embedding the ad id in it?

Who writes this shit? Who approves it? Who sits down, walks through the user scenario, and then says "Feature complete. Ship it!"

People who have a long list of priorities, and put me at the bottom of the list, what's who. And that's **fine**, they don't call me on the phone in the middle of my day and tell me to switch from Ruby to PHP, I won't tell them how to run an advertising business.

It probably makes perfect sense for them to set up customer-hostile service to discourage people like me from wasting their time. Just as it makes perfect sense for me to avoid customer dis-service like this. I have long agreed with people who say, *If you aren't buying ads from Facebook, you aren't their customer, you're their product, and that's why you receive shitty treatment.*

Now I know that even if you *are* buying ads, you may be their customer, but you still receive shitty treatment. Perhaps when you are buying ads a million dollars at a time, you get a human being as your sales rep, and their livelihood depends upon your ad spend, and they treat you differently.

I don't plan to find out. If and when I have a million dollars to spend on advertising, I will also have a marketing team, and they can deal with Facebook. Until then, it's time to advertise on Reddit. I'm going back to dance with the one I brought to the internet writing ball.
