I have decided not to speak at any Ruby-themed conferences in 2014.

I don't think this is particularly newsworthy. There are plenty of amazing speakers out there, folks like Katrina Owen and Sandi Metz. No conferences are going to be hurting for quality presentations just because I won't be there.

Nevertheless, I'm writing about my personal decision. This makes sense: I write a blog, not a column in a magazine. I'm not a journalist that uses the Internet as a medium, I'm "just an average guy." I'm supposed to write about the craft beer I tasted and whether I personally like iOS7. It is meet and just for me to write about things for an audience of one.

### i have no clothes

I'm shy and suffer from [Impostor Syndrome][^is]. Watching talks from accomplished people like Charles Nutter, I feel very intimidated. I have a real fear that someone will stand up and point out that I have nothing to say and I'm just babbling feel-good platitudes.

So for the most part, I already avoid speaking at conferences. When I was working, I was "too busy." When I was not working, I "couldn't afford it." There's always some excuse, and most of them have a grain of reasonableness to them.

But the shy thing is important to understand, because it ties in directly to the next point, which is that there is a lot of stress involved in being publicly associated with speaking at Ruby conferences.

[^is]: The **impostor syndrome**, sometimes called **impostor phenomenon** or **fraud syndrome**, is a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their accomplishments. Despite external evidence of their competence, those with the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved. Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent and competent than they believe themselves to be.

### a bit of history

Some time back, there was a regional conference. The organizers felt that the ruby-practitioners-to-ruby-conferences ratio could use some help in their region, so they put one on.

They worked hard to make sure that the talks would deliver value to the prospective attendees, and taken on a talk-by-talk basis, I recall that they did an excellent job.

However, somebody spotted that nearly all of the speakers selected for the conference were white men with conference speaking experience. He pointed that out on Twitter, and after a great deal of internet rioting, the conference was cancelled.

I feel a lot of empathy for everyone involved in that fracas. It sucks to look at a conference lineup and get the clear message that the "community" is extremely homogenized, as in "white milk."

It also sucks to be a speaker and be associated with this problem. All you did was live your life and submit a CFP. Or answer an email with the word, "Sure."

And how can it not suck to be an organizer under these circumstances? Here you are doing your best to make sure that the "Ruby Community" is a meritocracy, and you succeed. Then you discover that [merely being a meritocracy is not enough](http://braythwayt.com/2013/04/01/quote-metritocracy-unquote.html).

And guess what? It just happened again:

> The [RubyConf 2013 program](http://rubyconf.org/program) was partially announced yesterday and there was immediate fallout regarding the lack of women speakers. â€”[Marty Haught](http://martyhaught.com/articles/2013/09/18/rubyconf-2013-cfp-and-diversity/)

It seems we have a problem, a White Males At Conferences Problem. Or if you prefer, a Problem WIth White Males At Conferences Problem. Maybe both.

### meritorious or meretricious?

> Meritocracy gives us confidence that the people we appoint to lead are actually competent within the constraints of the system, but it says nothing about whether we have a system that identifies and supports all people equally from birth to reach these positions.

The White Males At Conferences Problem is interesting. It's an instance of a general management problem. I'll give you an easy example:

> You eat breakfast every day. You love steak and eggs, but you are also trying to control your body fat for personal reasons. At each breakfast, choosing steak-and-eggs provides more happiness than choosing yoghurt and grapefruit. However, if you never choose yoghurt you will gain weight in an unpleasant manner and wind up being unhappy for different reasons.

It's all about short-term sacrifices for long-term gains, or about adjusting the way you measure the value of your choices to take into account all of their consequences, or some other way to adjust things such that instead of choosing steak and eggs every day, you balance that with yoghurt and grapefruit so that you achieve the best *overall* outcome.

### white males are like steak and eggs

Seriously, I think guys like Jeremy Ashkenas and Avdi Grimm are intellectually yummy veal. Douglas Crockford is a finely aged tenderloin. Giles Bowkett is the jerk pork of the programming community.

But if we step back, it seems to many people that the overall diet is off. We aren't getting enough women, or people of colour, or people that look like the same-old-same-old but bring a new perspective.

(I was **blown away** at SpainJS this year by a Belgian guy who "Happened to be African.")

I like to hammer on a point, and this is a technical blog, so just think about coding as another instance. Should you code a new feature? Or refactor the old? There's no good way to make that decision on a case-by-case basis, you have to find a way to consider each feature and refactor choice in a larger context. That's why we develop software in sprints or milestones, so that we have a sufficiently large decision context.

And that's how we characterize our White Males "problem." We're making reasonable decisions in the small, but not getting a good outcome in the large, because we make each small decision in isolation rather than in a larger context.

### what should we do?

At the moment, we have this problem wherein the conference organizers are running businesses that reward them for serving steak and eggs. This is not their fault, if anything it's our fault: We're the ones buying tickets when we read that so-and-so will be keynoting "BreakfastRuby."

So we madly try to "fix it in post" by imposing negative consequences if they fail to satisfy our larger need for variety and diversity. That seems like a terrible way to fix the problem, but history suggests that you get more progress from action than talk, and it's easier to iterate towards good solutions than it is to try to devise the best strategy before trying anything at all.

I know there are people doing an amazing job with this. BaRuCo had what appeared to be diversity in the speaker's lineup and they ran an event for women interested in coding. I was pleased (in hindsight) to get called out for a careless comment about outsourcing in my own talk. That's a sign that **audiences will not put up with any shit**, and I'm proud of the people who spoke to me about the matter.

I don't really know what to do in the large. I'm not a woman, and although I have experienced a lot of discrimination in my life, these days I seem to be considered an honorary White Guy or something. In a very real sense, it's not my circus, not my monkey.

### what would raganwald do?

In the small, I think I'm going to sit on the sidelines while the "Ruby Community" sorts conferences out. I don't particularly want to wake up one day and have someone saying, "BreakfastRuby sucks, they have the same-old, same-old speakers like Raganwald, there's no diversity."

I don't want to be a line in someone else's spreadsheet, with a column for whether I've spoken at other conferences, or been a guest on Ruby Rogues, have written a book on Ruby, &c.

Mind you, I like that the spreadsheet exists! In the large, I want there to be action and talk and pitchforks and rioting. In the small, I want to personally live a quiet life and not find myself trying to explain to the crowd that I am an outsider and that almost all of my opinions about Ruby and/or Rails are heterodoxy.

So I'm opting out of speaking at Ruby conferences in 2014. It's not like I'm opting out of Ruby or the community, just out of a very narrow activity that I already find stressful. And I can't see this being a negative for anyone, it's not like conferences are going to fail if I don't show up. I'm not that important.

So, please go ahead and put on great conferences. Please go ahead and do as your conscience dictates to help move the community forward. I will be cheering you on... From my comfortable seat over here.
