I'm having a nightmare.

I'm lucid: I *know* this is a nightmare, I know I'll wake up with the sheets soaked in sweat and walk downstairs for a healing piss and glass of water, but right now I can't force myself awake and there's nothing I can do to quell the horror I'm experiencing even as I tell myself this isn't real. Oh God Oh God Oh God.

I'm at a conference. I'm one of the few black guys there. A speaker is on stage, nice guy, enjoyed playing Carcassonne with him a few years back somewhere-or-other. He's talking about Master-Slave replication, and his slide shows a woodcut of a negro slave being whipped by a white man.

"Yup," he's laughing, "You definitely want to be on the right end of the whip when fnording your foobars!" The audience is laughing, and damn if the fellow to my left isn't elbowing me in the ribs. Isn't THAT funny!

And yeah, no point in saying anything, It'll be another "Isn't HE taking things personally, it isn't offensive he just has a chip on his shoulder" conversations. Who needs that at an event where I'm supposed to be networking?

We've just acqui-hired a new, considerably less experienced team, and I'm being told why I will be reporting to their manager instead of the other way around. 

"Well," the President explains, "I'm concerned about the cultural fit. You see, they're from North Carolina, and I'm not sure how well they'd take direction from someone like you. I don't care personally, but this is a business."

I protest diplomatically, but the decision has been made. My job is to train my new boss how to do my job. "Maybe if you prove yourself to him, we can discuss this again. But that's the deal, roll with it."

I'm passed over for a CTO role in another company that opened up when the incumbent was given a "roving strategic role" for having an affair with the Oracle Salesman. My source on the board is sympathetic, but it seems the money men were aghast.

In one of their other investments, a well-educated engineer from Mumbai had three or four lawyers from his family pepper them with nuisance lawsuits when he discovered that their offer to him was 25% below what they were paying his caucasian peers.

"One fewer darkie with a C equals one fewer chance for a major discrimination lawsuit" is their reasoning, and the board voted me down. It's just money, it's not personal, I'm told.

I'm struggling and fighting and suddenly I'm surrounded by men in white sheets and they're shining a flashlight on me as they drag me away to be lynched, to hang from a tree as a warning to any other negro that gets uppity.

"Why couldn't you know your place?" I'm fighting, but there're too many of them, the bastards never come at you one at a time, they get together in packs where they can egg each other on.

I'm being dragged away, and as they're slinging the noose, a sympathetic man is offering me a last pull of whiskey to ease my journey to the other side.

"You know," he says, "One day things will be different. But today, this is how it is, and you're raising a ruckus is just making it hard for all the good black folks who just want to work an honest day for honest pay. You're the problem, not the solution, so this is how it;'s got to be."

God Rest Your Soul.

*I wake up, and as the piss roars into the toilet, I think:*

"It could have been worse. I might have been a woman in tech."
