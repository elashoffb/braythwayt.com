CMS includes a distribution and replication module. Users can take a replica of the database on the road and 'update' when connected to exchange data. The module can be configured to replicate the entire database or restrict replication to a specific sales territory or service coverage group. Replication can also be limited to certain types of information, such as activities or financials.
