> "In category theory, the concept of _catamorphism_ (from Greek: κατά = downwards or according to; μορφή = form or shape) denotes the unique homomorphism from an initial algebra into some other algebra. The concept has been applied to functional programming as folds."

> "In computer science, and in particular functional programming, a _hylomorphism_ is a recursive function, corresponding to the composition of an anamorphism (which first builds a set of results; also known as 'unfolding') and a catamorphism (which then folds these results into a final return value). Fusion of these two recursive computations into a single recursive pattern then avoids building the intermediate data structure. This is a particular form of the optimizing program transformation techniques collectively known as deforestation."

For a year or so, I have been [squatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersquatting) on [catamorphism.com](http://catamorphism.com) and [hylomorphism.com](http://hylomorphism.com) (My thought at the time was to use them for a book I was thinking of writing, and as a bonus they wouldn't get grabbed by some scummy domain name arbitrageur). I'm joining the throngs [heading for the godaddy.com exits](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3597319), and it seems like a good time to consider putting either or both of these domains to good use. So:

If you or someone you know could do something interesting with either or both of these domains, I would be delighted to transfer them. No compensation is required. It could be for a book about programming as I originally envisaged, a commercial venture like a startup, redirect to video lectures, anything at all, really. I would be delighted if it's something that [gratifies one's "intellectual curiosity."](http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)

Please tweet or pass this link along to folks who might have an interesting idea to suggest. Thanks in advance!
