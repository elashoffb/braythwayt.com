## Review: Five Ten "Minnaar" cycling shoes

Last night I took a new pair of [Five Ten Minnaars](https://fiveten.com/products/footwear-detail/23-minnaar) for a spin at [Joyride150](http://joyride150.com). Here's my review:

First off, let's get the basics out of the way. Minnaars are flat-soled sneaker-style shoes. They lace up and have a velcro strap for extra security. These are NOT XC-style shoes at all. That being said, they DO have an optional SPD cleat. If you want the cleat, you pop off a rubber insert and screw Shimano or Crank Brothers cleats in. I don't know if other cleats will fit in the space provided or not.

For riding, these are stiff shoes, much stiffer than the other Five Tens sneakers I ride. That makes sense: My other sneakers aren't SPD shoes, so they're meant to be ridden on flat pedals pushing down with the middle of the foot. Flex isn't an issue. But with SPD pedals, if the sole flexes you lose your pedal stroke. The downside is that these are going to be slightly less comfortable when walking around. That matters as well: One of the advantages of a sneaker-style shoe is that you can ride your bike somewhere, lock it up, and walk around in the same pair of shoes. I walked around all night in the Minnaars and they were fine, but they wouldn't be my first choice for sneakers to wear all day.

I should also point out that they are heavy, noticeably heavier than my other Five Ten flat shoes. I don't now why this is the case, but if you have visions of doing a hundred miles uphill in these shoes, snap out of it right now.

I tried the Minnaars with a pair of [Crank Brothers Mallet 2](http://crankbrothers.com/pedals_mallet2.php) pedals. The shoes have a hard plastic midsole covered by a thick Stealth rubber sole. You remove the rubber inserts covering the cleat mounting hardware to screw in your cleats. I found that the rubber sole was so thick that I needed to use a shim to help the cleats mate with the mallet pedals. This might not be necessary with other pedal designs. One advantage of this recessed cleat design is that when you walk in the shoes, the cleat doesn't protrude and make contact with the ground. That's nice.

**riding**

I rode around Joyride150, including the pump track, a simulated rock garden, and riding a log. This tested pumping, handling over uneven terrain, and maintaining balance. I didn't test them riding the simulated cross country loop. I figured 800m is not a real test of riding cross country, so why bother?

I ride the pump track "chainless" ( I don't really remove my chain, but I don't pedal either). This means pushing the bike with force over the bumps. The shoes were flawless, I flew around the track. The traditional pedal position took some getting used to for me, but if you already ride a clipless pedal these shoes will probably feel fine. In fact, I felt faster with these shoes, probably because I can now use my calves to push. Score one for the Minnaars, you ride faster with them than with flat sneakers.

I rode over to the Sport Skinnies section and jumped directly onto the rock garden without warming up. I figured this would be a great test or end my night with a trip to the hospital. Well, it was no problem. The Minnaars are actually aimed at the downhill and freeride crew, people who are hitting big stuff at seed. The idea behind a clipless pedal in these situations is to keep your feet from slipping off the pedals when the bike is being banged around rather than having anything to do with pedaling efficiency.

I figured a rock garden would be a good test, especially if I hit it hard instead of picking my way through it delicately as is my usual habit. So I flew onto it. Well, I shook a few fillings loose but my feet stayed on the pedals and I never felt out of control. I wondered if the different foot position would feel awkward, but no it was fine. Score another point for the Minnaars, I think they're more secure for situations like hitting rocks at speed.

The log was next. I hopped up on it and rode its length. Again, everything was fine. At the end I slightly muffed a wheelie drop, but I survived without falling, so I was fine again. On the other hand, being clipped in is bad if you need to leap off the bike. I'd give a half point to the Minnaars for this. They weren't in the way, but they weren't any different than flat pedals.

**gnarl**

Next I tried unclipping the Minnaars and riding them as flat shoes on the mallet pedals.  You'd do this if you were to hit a high skinny or something else where you might need to leap off the bike and do a "West Coast Bail," not just put your foot down. Uh uh. The Crank Brothers "eggbeater" cleat projects above the pedals' bed and you can't get a secure grip on the pedal. This is bad, but as I didn't try another type of pedal, I don't know if it's the Minnaars or the Mallets to blame. All I can say is, the combination of Mallets and Minnaars is no damn good for super technical riding, in my opinion.

That being said, if you're riding Minnaars clipless (even on Mallets) and you put your foot down, the super-sticky "Stealth" rubber is a lot more secure on a rock or a log than a typical XC shoe. It's terrible to put your foot down and then have it slip! And if you want to walk your bike through a super technical rocky section, the Minnaars are a lot more comfortable than XC shoes. So I am going to give the Minnaars a point even thought I hated, hated riding them unclipped on the Mallets.

After discovering that I wasn't effective riding them unclipped on the Mallets, I put my ordinary flat pedals back on and tried riding the Minaars. They were fine. I rode expert skinnies, practised a new rear wheel hop technique, and worked my quarter pedal kick off ladders all night in the Minaars. I left the cleats in, and they never interfered with the pedals. They were comfortable. I like that, because you can leave the inserts in and use them as purely flat shoes, and you will always have the option of putting cleats in them if you want. I will probably take them with me the next time I do a winter ride up in Mohawk/Hilton.

Overall, I am impressed. They are great flat shoes and they have the option of taking a cleat. Greg Minnaar seems to do downhill just fine with these shoes and Crank Brothers Mallets, so I won't say anything about that. I found them good for everything up to super-technical riding with cleats engaged, and I found them great on flat pedals. I'd recommend them to anyone interested in "all mountain" riding using cleats. I'd also recommend them as "Townie" or "Commuter" shoes for riding in the city where you want to get out and walk around. If you want to do super-technical stunts, I suggest that you select your pedals carefully.
