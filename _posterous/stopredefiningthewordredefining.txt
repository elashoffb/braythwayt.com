## Stop redefining the word "redefining."

I keep hearing about this "redefining marriage" business. Please stop calling this "redefining marriage." It's true that older laws used to be discriminatory and that we're removing overly narrow wording that no longer reflects the tolerance and openness our various societies practice. 

But it's the same old marriage, practiced the same way, just with more of our citizens being recognized as equal under the law than before. We didn't call it "redefining marriage" when we got rid of wrong and discriminatory laws that barred whites from marrying blacks. We simply said, "We're dragging ourselves into the 20th century." 

Now we're dragging ourselves into the 21st century. It's just marriage, now with less discrimination. Just as we haven't redefined our society, we have the same people, just we're more equal under the law. 

So please stop redefining the word "redefining." It's just marriage, just as those participating in it are just citizens. 

As RoboCop would say, "Thank you for your co√∂peration."
