## Worth repeating

> The entire quote-unquote "pro blogging" industry --- which exists as the sort of pimply teenage brother to the shirt-and-tie SEO industry --- is predicated on the notion that blogging is a meaningful verb. It is not. The verb is _writing_. The format and medium are new, but the craft is ancient.---John Gruber, [Obsession Times Voice](http://daringfireball.net/2009/03/obsession_times_voice)
