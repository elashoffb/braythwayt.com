## Netflix and the Costs of Courage

Netflix is in the business of sending atoms to people by post. Like Amazon, they have woken up to the fact that the atoms they are moving around are actually representations of bits, and it is better in every way to move those bits around through channels designed for moving bits, namely the Internet. The trouble is this: Making a profound change to your business nearly always means pissing everybody off.

**Change**

Employees fear change. And rightly so! Are the members of your shipping and logistics team going to go back to school and retrain themselves as networking engineers? Your existing suppliers and customers will resist the change. In the short term, it's bad for them. Always. For every established business, there are tremendous forces that oppose tearing up the old business plan and writing a new one.

Meanwhile, if Netflix does nothing, it will take time---sometimes a great deal of time---before they are obsoleted completely. During that time there are profits to be extracted from laggard markets, salaries to be a earned, and bonuses to be paid. It's hard to be fired for doing your job well. It takes courage to ask whether your job ought to be done at all. It takes courage to decide that [today is the day to make change](http://raganwald.posterous.com/javas-comb-over).

When you do make change, when you do announce the new direction, do people embrace you? No. People will say that they think it's a good idea in theory, but they oppose the implementation. They will say Netflix should have down this and shouldn't have done that. Netflix, they will say, ought to transition to streaming media, but not yet, or not like this. It shouldn't spin off its DVD business. It shouldn't split the billing. [The CEO's email](http://blog.netflix.com/2011/09/explanation-and-some-reflections.html) should be more conciliatory. And so on.

I have a not-so-secret secret for you: If they did things differently, there would still be a deafening chorus of complaints. Possibly different people, possibly the same. Possibly different complaints, possibly the same. But make no mistake, **there is no right way for a company to disrupt themselves**.

**What about Apple?**

Hang on! I see your hand raised!! Watch my mind-reading prowess: You are going to tell me about Apple and OS X and iPhones. You are going to tell me about IBM and global services. You are going to tell me about Microsoft and Windows. Or perhaps even about a mining company from Minnesota and tacky glue. You are going to say that many, many companies have successfully disrupted themselves.

And I am going to tell you that we only ever judge their success in hindsight. At the time the companies made changes, it was very painful. It involved criticism and Monday morning quarterbacking. Pundits came out of the woodwork to tell them why they won't succeed in the new business. Customers walked away from the old business because they were no longer the focus. Employees quit in droves.

It is perfectly normal for it to **suck** when an established company tries to "pivot." The bigger and more successful the company, the more it sucks. So yes, it sucks. Yes, it is going to hurt, a lot. Yes, customers are going to leave. Yes, employees are going to quit. Yes, movie companies aren't going to like it. Yes, yes, yes. [Your complaints are all valid](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3012206). Your observations about the downsides, the costs, the risks, and the perils are all sensible and correct observations.

**Never quote me the odds**

There is absolutely no guarantee that Netflix will successfully disrupt itself. Historically speaking, the odds are against them. Most companies that try to disrupt themselves fail. They end up gutting their old business but fail to build a comparable new business, so they end up with nothing. That sucks. But historically speaking, almost every business that fails to disrupt itself when disruption occurs in their market are going to fail any ways. Disruption sucks, there is no question about that. There is pain and suffering ahead for Netflix no matter what. There are angry customers ahead for Netflix no matter what.

So it comes down to this: The odds are against them succeeding with this plan. That makes it easy to criticize: It's painful now, and it's easy to see that it is unlikely to succeed. However, the odds are even worse if they do nothing, however it is hard to criticize doing nothing because that isn't painful _yet_.

In the fullness of time, we'll know whether they have saved themselves from a grisly fate or whether they leapt from the frying pan to the fire. Until then, by all means criticize. Just keep in mind that the pain, the suffering, the choices that lead to lost customers and employees walking away... These are the costs of courage.

post scriptum: Never mind Netflix. Is there's something in your life or your business that needs to be changed? Does it look painful? Do you have to walk away from friends, from success, from colleagues? Maybe that's normal and to be expected. I say to you: Courage!
