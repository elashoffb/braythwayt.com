## The story that tells itself

One evening, Raganwald ventured into a university town's local tavern and found a circle of professors greatly enjoying themselves. He watched and listened from a spot just inside the tavern's door. He saw someone stand and speak briefly, then heard the throng roar its approval. He saw another fellow, taking his turn, rise and utter a few syllables. Again, those gathered returned a chorus of laughter. 

Raganwald moved closer to the center to hear better. "1977!" he heard, and laughter. "1981!" The regulars laughed again. He nudged the man closest to him and asked, "What's going on?" "We've all been members of the faculty forever. We like to entertain ourselves with stories, and always the same stories.

Long ago, we began laughing before the teller could complete the punch line. Later, we dispensed with the middle parts too. A few words to set up the story were enough to refresh our memories. Most recently, we dropped even the introductions and began identifying the stories just by the year we first heard them." "May I try?" Raganwald asked. "1959!" 

Silence fell over the crowd. One fellow spoke up. "You must be a Lisp programmer. Am I right?" 

"Why, yes!" Raganwald answered. "How can you tell?" 

The group broke into laughter. Wiping the tears from his eyes, the man next to him explained. "Lisp programmers love that one. It's the story that tells [itself](http://raganwald.posterous.com/another-meta-joke)."
