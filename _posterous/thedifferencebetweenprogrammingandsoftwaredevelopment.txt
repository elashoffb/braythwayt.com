## The difference between programming and software development

> Let us take software development. I am making perhaps an arbitrary distinction between "programming" and "software development". So let me be clear**. Programming is solving a well-defined problem. Software development is defining the problem in the first place.** Once you have a question, it is usually easy to solve it once you have the tools and the knowledge to use them. If you don't know the question, things become a lot harder.

It is also about working with multiple people to build a coherent quality system. It happens in the real world where things can go wrong and frequently do. I don't need to elaborate because you know what I am talking about. It is far easier for a single programmer to pick a problem and solve it than for a huge team to define the problem and set about to find a solution to it.
