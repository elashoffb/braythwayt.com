## Summon Monsters? Open The Door? Heal? Or Die?

I snarfed the title of this post from [Giles Bowkett](http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2008/05/summon-monsters-open-door-heal-or-die.html). Like him, I've written a [self-indulgent post](http://raganwald.posterous.com/summon-monsters-open-the-door-heal-or-die) explaining why I'm taking some time off Hacker News. In fact, I just [added news.ycombinator.com to my hosts file](http://127.0.0.1). The only difference between us is that I'm not blaming Hacker News for broadening its community and allowing trolls in. No grumbling about Eternal September here.

The reason I'm withdrawing from Hacker News is really the same reason I stopped writing a formal blog some time ago. I wanted to spend more time writing code and less time writing words about code. A few days ago I found myself whinging that pre-announcing a new framework has a chilling effect on developers who are choosing a framework for their next product. Do they use what's available today? Or do they wait for the wonderful new thing that is coming Real Soon Now? I stand by the logical truth of my point, but was I improving the incumbent framework's code? Was I writing code for the new framework? No.

I also found myself on the other side of the fence from people who tell me that is an author is almost completely wrong about the conclusions he draws from events he observes, that his post doesn't belong on Hacker News even if some [very, very few](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/10/how-to-use-blunt-instrument-to-sharpen.html) of the things he muses about in his post might be both contrarian and correct. Well guess what? Nobody who disagrees with me is wrong. They just disagree. No harm in that. Should things I like be flagged as inappropriate? Why not? Maybe _I'm_ the one with a screw loose.

But what does any of this have to do with code? **Nothing**. Arguing about other people's words is just as unproductive as writing my words. They're just words about words, they aren't original words and they certainly aren't lines of code. And meanwhile, time ticks away and lost time is something I can never recover, never get back.

I went to see a psychiatrist about why I'm spending so much time thinking about words about words instead of code, and he was rather direct in his therapeutic approach:
