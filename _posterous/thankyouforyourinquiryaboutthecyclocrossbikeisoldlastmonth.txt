_No problem, I would be delighted to sell you my bike for $1,000, I would love to help a student out. Of course, I will need to downgrade some of the components, I imagine you won't mind.

Let me know when we can discuss what components would suit your needs within your budget_.

  


I have been getting a lot of emails like this. I sold the bike a month ago, so I imagine that anyone sending an email like this will think that if the bike is still for sale I might be flexible about the price. Also, it's a bike so it might be easy to resell.

  
I wouldn't think too much of it except for one thing. Many of them look very similar. I wonder... Has someone written a bot that scours old craigslist ads looking for "motivated vendors?" That would be interesting.

In any case, I like tossing out a friendly "let's negotiate" proposition like the one above. I haven't gotten a response yet--not even a "no thanks, all or nothing"--which supports my suspicion that these are not students or anyone else on a limited budget, just one or more people looking for a bargain and prepared to operate on a pretext in the pursuit of value.

It seems like another internet effect. By reducing the cost of exchanging information to nearly zero, the Internet makes all sorts of low-probability opportunities become viable micro- or even macro-businesses.

Fascinating.
