## Weak Players

You have to cross-train to be a decent athlete these days. Programmers need to be fluent in multiple languages with fundamentally different "character" before they can make truly informed design decisions.---[Code's Worst Enemy](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/12/codes-worst-enemy.html)

One thing I'm coming to suspect is that while he's right, there's a little more going on than a lack of fluency in multiple paradigms. I suspect there's a deeper, more general schism between programmers who believe in the concept of an "X Programmer" and programmers who don't. I'd say Steve doesn't believe in X Programmers, he believes it's important to transcend whatever language you happen to be using at the moment.

What I find interesting about this isn't the idea that someone may describe himself as a JavaScript programmer, a Lisp programmer, or a Haskell programmer. What I find interesting about this is the way some people label _each other_ by the programming languages they use, and nearly always in opprobrious terms. I read things like "I'd expect as much from a Ruby programmer" or "Another mouth-breathing .NET programmer" or even "When did they let the CoffeeScript kiddies in here?"

I almost never read such terms mixed in with otherwise deeply insightful discussion and criticism. It seems like it's always just another Ad Hominem personal flame that adds noise but no signal to a discussion. Now, I have little to go on except for what I read when I click through people's comment history to get a feel for what kind of value they bring to the table, but here is my conjecture:

> The kind of person who hangs a label on another programmer based on the programming language they use is a weak player, regardless of the language they hold in poor regard.

I suspect that the problem is that deep down, the source of the insult is the world view is that all programmers are X programmers, and what separates the wheat from the chaff is the value of X. Whereas I (and I think Yegge) hold the view that the current value of X is not as important as the breadth and depth of experience a programmer brings to bear when using X.

Of course, there may be a simpler explanation. Perhaps the kind of quarrelsome, cynical person who is always trying to "score points" on the Internet by making fun of other people is a weak contributor, and it has nothing to do with the particular way in which they go about trying to put other people down. Who knows?

p.s. This is, of course, almost entirely an Internet discussion group phenomenon. Colleagues never need to use phrases like "That fsking Ruby programmer," they can speak directly to the havoc created with the tools: "That idiot who used operational transforms where a simple REST-ful object store would have sufficed."
