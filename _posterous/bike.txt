Wheels upgraded to lightweight, mud-shedding Reynolds Solitude wheels with Titanium skewers. Wheels raced 1/2 season. Brakes upgraded to Tektro CR720s for maximum stopping power in wet or muddy conditions. Shimano or Crank Brothers Eggbeater pedals, your choice at no extra charge. Compare to Kona's MSRP of $1`,599+tax: Wheels were $600, brakes, seatpost , and crank brothers pedals more $$$$. Letting it go at a bargain price to pay for my bike addiction... Just in time to train for Cross Season!

How amazing that you are looking at advertisements that are over one year old. I'm sure that of all of the things that haven't been sold after such a long time, a few will belong to owners that just want  to dump the troublesome thing. Lucky for you, it IS still for sale and I accept your offer of $600. Please send the $600 by Western Union to my business address, and I will have my cousin in Canada ship you the bike:

Prince Reginald Braithwaite

If you have any questions, please feel free to call my cell phone: (234 1) 262-2512/13/15

Thanks!
