## The freedom to eat pizza

Once again the Apple Overlords are exacting further tithes from their [sharecroppers](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/12/WebsThePlace), and the chattering classes are raising a deafening hullaballoo. What's the issue? Quite simply, iOS---iPhone and iPad---applications that exist to serve or play content that is purchased elsewhere. For example, ebook readers that "play" books purchased from Amazon. Readers for subscriptions to newspapers and magazines. And lots of other things built around the model of razors and blades. Apple's issue is simple: They used to own a razor store and they exacted a 30% shakedown fee or sales commission from selling razors through their app store.

Giving away the razors and selling the blades elsewhere neatly exploits a loophole in Apple's revenue model. Bravo, Amazon, you sure taught Apple a lesson in creative thinking! Now Apple have learned the lessons and have instituted a new policy to get 30% of the blade sales as well:

> "Our philosophy is simple---when Apple brings a new subscriber to the app, Apple earns a 30 percent share; when the publisher brings an existing or new subscriber to the app, the publisher keeps 100 percent and Apple earns nothing," said Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO. "All we require is that, if a publisher is making a subscription offer outside of the app, the same (or better) offer be made inside the app, so that customers can easily subscribe with one-click right in the app. We believe that this innovative subscription service will provide publishers with a brand new opportunity to expand digital access to their content onto the iPad, iPod touch and iPhone, delighting both new and existing subscribers."

In other words, if you sell subscriptions, you have two options. First, sell them within the application and give Apple 30% of everything. Or second, sell them both within _and_ outside of the application, and only give Apple 30% of the revenue from the sales within the application. You keep all of the revenue for sales outside of that application. Existing customers can take all their content to their iPhone or iPad. Amazon customers who prefer to purchase their content from Amazon can carry on doing that. For example, discovering content online through Amazon's collaborative filtering and SEO will still purchase content through Amazon and it will play just fine on their iPad without Apple getting a cent.

Amazon is a corporate killing machine. It extermintaes outmoded business models without mercy. Apple is treating Amazon like it's the enemy. Which it is: Amazon sell kindles, Amazon sells music, and Amazon would bury Apple in an unmarked grave if it could. Or more realistically, Amazon would reduce Apple to being a PC-manufacturing style sharecropper if it could, reduced to selling book players with no differentiation except price while Amazon racks up the trillions of dollars in sales of the books themselves. I shed no tears for Amazon or Apple: Both companies are fighting to make it impossible for me to loan you a book from my shelf or will a book to my children without giving them money.

Speaking as an iPad user, these rules make my life easier. Having every app try to get around the 30% with its own hoop jumping exercise is a pain for me. I already do business with Apple and Amazon, so I can continue to do business with Apple and Amazon as I see fit. If O'Reilly wants to get me to buy a Safari subscription, I can buy it from them directly or I can buy through the application. Fine. So what's the problem here?

**ecosystems and theme parks**

Freedom, apparently. A bunch of people want the freedom to make money as they see fit on Apple's back. Apple were the ones that invested the money and time and took the chance to figure out how to make a Tablet that people want to buy. Now Joe Shmoe is complaining that he can't make a proprietary application written in a proprietary programming language interfacing to a proprietary operating system running on proprietary hardware without Apple trying to get 30% of whatever revenue model he dreams up. Well cry me a fucking river.

This is what **always** happens when people build proprietary "ecosystems," They try to get sharecroppers to till their land for them, and the deal is always in the interests of the ecosystem owner first, the ecosystem's customers second, and the sharecropper comes a distant tenth. I don't know who is in third through ninth place, but it isn't someone who develops for someone else's operating system.

When we put it like this, we see that "ecosystem" is the wrong word. iOS isn't an "ecosystem," it's a theme park. Apple owns the park, the users are the customers, and developers are operating little franchise booth thingies at the pleasure of the owner.

> iOS isn't an ecosystem, it's a theme park.

Apache is an ecosystem. Unix is an ecosystem. Javascript is an ecosystem. iOS is not an ecosystem, and neither is anything else controlled by a proprietary vendor. If you don't believe me, have a look at Java. Proprietary vendors like Apple and Amazon behave in predatory ways towards each other and the sharecroppers trying to earn a living within their theme parks.

And thus it comes down to this. Amazon wants to sell you pizza to eat in Apple's theme park. Apple says "fine," but Apple insists that Amazon set up a stand inside Apple's theme park where Apple can skim 30% off the top of Amazon's pizza business. So far, just like Disneyworld. Only what's this? If you buy your pizza at Amazon's restaurant outside the park, you can actually take it into Apple's theme park and eat all you want. The only things Apple is actually prohibiting are (1) Charging extra for pizza eaten inside the park, or (2) Operating a booth inside the park that's a front for a delivery service where you order pizza from inside the booth and Amazon delivers it from their restaurant. That's a better deal than a real theme park. Just try ordering out for pizza from inside Disneyworld's gates.

From a proprietary perspective, Apple's current policy seems reasonable. After all, anyone who's _really_ interested in freedom would be developing free software and delivering it to iOS devices as web content.  Everyone else doesn't actually want freedom, they want the unlimited freedom to exploit Apple's hard-won customers at Apple's expense. An argument that defends Amazon's right to exploit me without Apple muscling in on their business of imposing DRM on books is a rather curious way of advancing "freedom."

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to lie down and read a book made out of atoms. It seems like it won't be long before these will be regarded as the good old days when we could buy a book and actually own what we bought.

p.s. An [interesting comment](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2227974) says, in part:

> I was almost completely buying into the theme park and pizza concession analogy. But then I thought of the one exception. You're allowed to buy Amazon pizza outside of the park and bring it in for free, but only if Amazon has agreed to set up a pizza shop inside the park as well.
