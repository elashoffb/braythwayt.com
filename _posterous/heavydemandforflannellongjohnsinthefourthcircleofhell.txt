## Heavy demand for flannel long johns in the Fourth Circle of Hell

What has happened? Microsoft is not only a tech underdog these days, but it's also the voice of reason. Here's the text of [an advertisement Microsoft is running](http://marketingland.com/microsoft-slams-google-privacy-search-changes-with-putting-people-first-ad-campaign-4887):

> Google is in the process of making some unpopular changes to some of their most popular products. Those changes, cloaked in language like "transparency," "simplicity" and "consistency," are really about one thing: making it easier for Google to connect the dots between everything you search, send, say or stream while using one of their services.
> 
> But, the way they're doing it is making it harder for you to maintain control of your personal information. Why are they so interested in doing this that they would risk this kind of backlash? One logical reason: Every data point they collect and connect to you increases how valuable you are to an advertiser.
> 
> To be clear, there's nothing inherently wrong with wanting to improve the quality of an advertising product. But, that effort needs to be balanced with continuing to meet the needs and interests of users. Every business finds its own balance and attracts users who share those priorities. Google's new changes have upset that balance, with users' priorities being de-prioritized. That's why people are concerned and looking for alternatives.
> 
> If these changes rub you the wrong way, please consider using our portfolio of award-winning products and services....

I have and will continue to criticize Microsoft for behaviour I find opprobrious. As a private citizen, I am under no moral compunction to praise or shill for them when I agree with something they say and do. I suspect that their motives for calling Google out are similar to those of oppressive dictators in exile who criticize the oppressive dictators in possession.

But regardless of their character, circumstances, or motives, I agree with what they're saying even if my response to Google's actions is to say:

"Google, Yahoo, and Bing thither, me [hither](http://duckduckgo.com)."

p.s. _Nickieben Bourbaki responded on Hacker News:_

> Mr. Raganwald, this is your friend Nickieben Bourbaki. They are mostly right about Google but partially wrong (as explained in another response). They are entirely wrong about it being a good idea about trying their products (also explained in another response). But more interestingly, they are entirely wrong about their business strategy here.
> 
> [FUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt) was perfected by IBM when they were the Goliath of computing. When you're the consensus #1, you are the safe choice. Therefore, if you can make something else appear unsafe, you are going to drive customers to your "safe haven."
> 
> In search and data collection, Is Microsoft a safe haven? No. In the eyes of the marketplace, Google probably is, even if nerds and privacy wonks don't agree. FUD is something Google could probably get away with, but it is going to backfire as a business tactic for Microsoft.
> 
> Although idealists like yourself would love it if users left both services for alternatives like Duckduckgo, what will actually happen is that anyone who reads the ads and becomes aware that these giant companies are collecting personal data is going to decide to go with someone they trust. Right now, that's Google, not Microsoft. This is especially true in technical circles where Microsoft has absolutely zero moral credibility.
> 
> Therefore, I suggest to you that yes, they may be right about Google in some respects, but this is the wrong ad to run for Microsoft the business.
