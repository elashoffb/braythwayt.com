## The West still leads the world in propaganda

As relayed from Reddit thoughÂ [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2052464):

> Someone was talking about a colleague of his who was Chinese and had come to the US, and who, over dinner with some other colleagues, said: "I can't believe how smooth your propaganda is here in the US. In China it is crude and everyone can see through it, but here you almost miss it." To which all of the other colleagues replied: "What are you talking about? We don't have propaganda in the US!"
