## What I've learned about human rights in 2013

"We didn't actually plan to put someone in jail for a half-century for a victim-less crime. Mind you, we did drag out a ruinously expensive legal negotiation that put their life on hold and drained their personal and family's savings."

"We threatened to make an example of them by jailing them for what would have amounted to the rest of their life. We intended to have them declared a felon and be treated like a criminal. And we planned to do it without allowing them to face a jury of their peers in an open courtroom."

"We'd never tell them that we'd seek no more than six months even if they were convicted in court, we don't want to encourage people to question the merits of our prosecutorial choices."

"So, we subjected them to the maximum possible presure and terror while we went home and slept soundly at night. That's how we treat someone presumed to be innocent, we do our best to create a situation where they agree of their own accord to be treated as if they were guilty."Â 

"Meanwhile, buy up the guns, folks. An assault rifle is a basic right and besides, it is absolutely no threat to those of us watching everything you do and monitoring everything you say. Whereas, the laptops that can be hooked up to networks in closets, they threaten our ability to tell you what to do, when to do it, and why it must be done."
