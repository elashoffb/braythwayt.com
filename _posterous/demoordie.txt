## Demo or Die

Unspace ([http://unspace.ca](http://unspace.ca)) was a weekly all-hands meeting. The purpose is to keep everyone abreast of progress. We discuss our progress qualifying or closing prospective clients, we discuss what's happening with ongoing projects, and we even share progress on our side projects. I've demoed my Go ([http://github.com/raganwald/go](http://github.com/raganwald/go)) project and the iGesture plugin to my colleagues.

  


There's nothing like a demo with a date attached to really focus your efforts. Even if progress is slow, a weekly demo establishes a heartbeat, a kind of informal iterative development process. Of course, we should never mistake activity for progress. I may be going around in circles, giving demo after demo of UI tweaks while doing nothing about getting Heroku to send new game notifications by email (guilty!) But at the very least, giving a weekly demo guarantees that I'm *going* around in circles. Without a weekly demo, I might grind to a complete halt while I play with database schemas or build a framework for performing monte-carlo position evaluation in the cloud.

  


The MIT Media Lab's motto was "Demo or Die," meaning that projects had to generate compelling demos or lose funding. It's a worthy philosophy.
