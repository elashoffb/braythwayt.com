## A question about Quora

Inspired by the hype, I tried answering a question on [Quora](http://quora.com). My feeling about Quora is the exact same as my feeling about Twitter, Facebook, StackOverflow, Hacker News, Reddit, Wikipedia, Pinkbike, and all other private services whether for profit or not. They are fun and entertaining, but I am only going to put disposable words in them. I can live with Posterous going dark one day and losing all of the words I write here. I don't bother to back them up (although I suppose I could recover the original, unedited drafts from emails if I was really motivated).

I could not live with losing the words I've written on the original [raganwald](http://weblog.raganwald.com) blog or on [homoiconic](https://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic#readme). Which is why when I write words that I consider important to me, I use technologies where I always control the content. If Github ever goes dark, I can republish my entire homoiconic blog in a few minutes on my own hosted site. Sure, it would be inconvenient and all the web links would break. But thanks to search, the web would eventually repair itself and my words would find their way out into the world again.

Not so with Quora. If Quora is turned off, my words are gone forever. That doesn't mean it's useless to me: Quora does seem like a good place to answer questions, especially questions that are ephemeral in nature like "Why did BigCo invest in HotNewStartup?" But some questions are timeless and important. I am uneasy about giving them deep thought and then placing them in a fragile medium.

And thus to my question: _If the only words I put into Quora are those I don't value enough to publish myself, why should I ask anyone else to bother reading them?_
