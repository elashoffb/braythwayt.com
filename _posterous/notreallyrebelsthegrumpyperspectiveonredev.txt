## Not Really Rebels: The Grumpy Perspective on Øredev

[The Grumpy Programmer](http://grumpy-learning.com) went to Øredev, and [this is what he had to say](http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2012/11/17/not-really-rebels/):

> Thursday's opening keynote was by fellow Canadian Reg Braithwaite where he really talked about rebellious people, and the 4 most common roles we find within any marketplace of ideas: Leader, Rival, Innovater, Everyone Else. Fascinating analysis of how people's refusal to understand these four roles leads to much unhappiness and even how entities move from one role to another.

Actually, this was by far the least interesting part of his [observations](http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2012/11/17/not-really-rebels/).

It's always interesting when there's talk of rebellion or innovation or disruption or startups, yet the pricing and other arrangements seem to target the corporate crowd. Will you get "tourists," people who dream of rebellion yet settle for wearing a beret to their job in a cubicle farm? Will you get people who are on the verge of splintering a group into a skunkworks in order to disrupt their existing businesses? Will you get people who are ready to tell their boss to take this job and shove it?

That was one of the reasons I found Øredev so interesting. Here is this big, well-run conference with a theme of rebellion. It was hosted in the city of Malmö, a city reinventing itself for a new century. In a continent, Europe, that is reinventing itself. The experience was fascinating, and the Grumpy take on it is a very good read.

I recommend this essay very highly. Except for the bit about my talk. I think he's having a rare fit of kindness.
