## Roger Ebert can't be talking about programming

> The purpose of a cult is exclusion. If you're not in the cult, you are by definition lacking some essential quality shared by its members. Those inside the cult can feel privileged, even gifted, by their ability to Get It. I was willing to Get It, I was sincerely prepared, but at the end of this experience, I concluded there was nothing to be Got.

No, I've never once felt that way reading about a hip new programming language or paradigm, not once, never, programming doesn't work that way, it isn't a [pop culture](http://raganwald.posterous.com/giles-bowkett-summons-monsters), not at all.

Nope-a-roonie!
