## Wow, who would down vote me for that!?!?!?

From my mailbag:

For the most part it works as advertised, but from time to time I see someone write something [on-topic and perfectly sensible](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3670935), yet they get downvoted.

Dear Helpless:

Even small children, the mentally feeble, and the MPAA know that no matter how right-thinking you are, when you say something on the Internet, someone, somewhere is going to disagree with what you said, where you said it, or when you chose to say it.

They may be wrong-headed. They may have been in a hurry and didn't read what you wrote very carefully. They may have disliked something else you wrote to the point where they automatically downvote you. They may think you are that low creature, a Javascript and/or Ruby programmer skulking in the undergrowth and eating trash.

Whatever the reason, it happens, and when you argue with them, you simply amplify the noise at the expense of signal. [Note how poorly this thread goes](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/mfmxx/williams_master_of_the_come_from/c311r7d). The correct response is to shrug and move along with your day. Or better still, ask yourself if they have an idea worth considering, no matter how much it smarts to receive criticism.

After all, the entire point of engaging with other human beings is to exchange ideas with people who are different from you. It can't always be about exchanging information that never conflicts with your existing world view. In fact, the most valuable things you'll ever learn are the ones that force you to let go of something you previously believed to be true and unassailable.

So when you write something nice and sensible and nevertheless it gets downvoted... I suggest you smile and say to yourself "This proves that I am, in fact, interacting with other people, all is going as intended."
