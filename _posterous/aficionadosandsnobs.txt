## Aficionados and Snobs

A**n aficionado** is "a person who likes, knows about, and appreciates a usually fervently pursued interest or activity." A **snob** is "one who has an offensive air of superiority in matters of knowledge or taste." Think about these two words the next time there's a programming language debate on the Internet. Are you going to be an aficionado? Or a snob?

(Comment: A lot of the difference comes down to whether you _personalize_ programming language choices. There is a massive difference between telling me that you don't agree with my choice of Ruby for a project and telling me that you don't respect Ruby programmers. The question of personalizing things has some deep personal ramifications.
