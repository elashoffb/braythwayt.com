## An open letter to the Hacker News community

I recently passed 25,000 karma on Hacker News ([http://news.ycombinator.com](http://news.ycombinator.com)). 

That and $3.00 will get me a double espresso, so please hold off on the congratulatory telegrams. But as a milestone, it is a useful reminder to stop for a moment and reflect. 

I've been actively using Hacker News since its inception. Given the sheer volume of submissions and comments I've made, it's no surprise I have some karma. It's much easier to gain karma than to lose it, so I imagine most active users will gain karma over time. 

Thus, having a chunk of karma does not necessarily mean that I've been making a substantial contribution to the community. I just might be making a persistently mediocre contribution. Or perhaps I've been making popular but unhelpful contributions: Popularity is not strongly correlated with value in the attention economy. 

So for that reason, I am reaching out and asking: As I make the trek from 25,001 to 50,000 karma, how could I be an even better member of the community? Longer comments? Shorter comments? Fewer self-aggrandizing links to my own blog posts? Submit more of the kinds of links I tweet? Submit fewer links? 

Should I try harder to avoid meta-comments? Be less cranky? Be more economical in my exposition? 

I'm open to any suggestion you might care to share, either on [Hacker News itself](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2715202) or by email if you prefer to send me a private note: [reg@braythwayt.com](mailto:reg@braythwayt.com). 

Thank you in advance. I sincerely appreciate your feedback.
