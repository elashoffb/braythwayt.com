## An open comment to Blog Leaders regarding "Opinionated."

I was reading anÂ [interesting post about Javascript syntax](http://blog.izs.me/post/2353458699/an-open-letter-to-javascript-leaders-regarding) when I came across this (I reproduce it in the original author's text sizing to give you an idea that he isn't merely saying something, he's shouting it):

## The Part Where I Get All

## Opinionated and Piss You Off

## (despite a noble effort to the

## contrary)

I see.

Well, having an opinion is good. Sharing your opinion is better. Writing "The Part Where I Get All Opinionated and Piss You Off" or other equivalent chest-beating braggadocio about how you don't need me to like you distracts me from your opinion and thus is bad because it dilutes your message.

**The only thing that pisses me off about opinionated blog posts is wading through opinions about being opinionated when what I really want is your opinion.**
