## The "Don't act like a dick" rule

Here's some unsolicited advice I offered in response to a question about how to sell online to women:

Most women I know would be happy if you followed the "Don't act like a dick" rule. It's really simple. There are times when you want to act like a dick, but nudge nudge, wink wink, you think we know you aren't really a dick so you think it's ok. For example, if you are writing a blog post and you give it the title "_Why learning javascript will help you launch your startup, conquer the world, and sleep with the prom queen_," you're acting like a dick. You may think it's a nudge nudge, wink wink, kind of acting like a dick, but it's still acting like a dick.

  
If you just stop doing that, you'd be surprised how much more traction you will get with women. And visible minorities. And a bunch of other people. It's not so much that we're outraged or offended or will protest and call for laws against stupid marketing ploys, but such writing often takes the tone that you and a bunch of other boys are in a cozy little club and we aren't invited. This makes us take our money and spend it somewhere else.

Now that I've got this off my chest, it occurs to me that a man talking about what might offend a woman is a little _patronizing_. So part two of my advice is, don't act like a dick, but don't cozy up and pretend you understand how someone feels and get all patronizing like you have the answer to someone else's problems. That isn't exactly acting like a dick, but it can be just as bad.

Maybe we'd better forget the whole thing.
