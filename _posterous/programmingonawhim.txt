## Programming on a whim

On the Tuck and Patti official [FAQ Page](http://www.tuckandpatti.com/faq2.html#u), I read this:

> The sense in which I play for myself is on a very detailed level that no one would ever know about; I think of it as the realm of whim. Almost constantly there are multiple options for ways to create the same sound (alternate fingerings or picking patterns), or there are equally good musical choices at a given moment (details of a voicing, degree of emphasis of various notes within a chord, angles of attack, details of underlying percussive subtext, etc.). Here, even though the specific choices would make no difference to a listener, or even to Patti, I see it as critical that I constantly exercise whim as much as possible rather than fall into doing things the same way all the time. It makes me more and more flexible. It gives rise to unplanned possibilities that do make a difference. I even suspect that sometimes it keeps my mind busy and out of the way so the music can flow through me more naturally. The boundary of details between what matters and what doesn't matter in music is elusive and very important. By constantly interacting with it, I believe I come closer to correctly balancing the ego with the music.  ---Tuck Andress

This struck a chord with me. In programming, there are many ways to do the same thing, even within the "limitation" of a single language or framework. Exercising different ways "on a whim" makes the programmer more flexible. It opens the door to unplanned possibilities. It keeps the conscious mind busy doing the same old thing in a new way so that the subconscious mind can solve an important question.

I believe that the boundaries between what matters and what doesn't matter in programming---as in music---is elusive and very important. Constantly interacting with it is a part of my personal style, that's why I work with ideas like #andand or adding [Block Anaphora](http://github.com/raganwald/rewrite_rails/blob/master/doc/block_anaphora.md#readme) to languages that don't have them.

And most importantly, that's why I encourage you to be a little whimsical.Try doing the same thing in slightly different ways. Even---no, _especially---_if the difference is invisible to someone using your code. Spend some time with boundaries between what matters and what does not. Let your "music" flow.
