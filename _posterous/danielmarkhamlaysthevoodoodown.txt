## Daniel Markham Lays The Voodoo Down

> FP says that you don't have to have 20 thousand libraries. Or rather, you're welcome to have as many libraries as you want, but you develop those 30-70 functions that you use most often in your job and _re-use them_ Instead of learning a new problem domain for each project and then working inside of it little piece by little piece, you're creating you own minimal set of symbols that work on _all_ of your projects, thereby making each new project more and more trivial.

> OO code, on the other hand, is rarely reused. By the time you've written your Customer object, it's so dependent on the framework it is in and the way that it is used that every object you make is basically a one-of for that particular project. Sure, you can wrap potentially reusable code into objects of your own, but I've been doing this over 20 years and I can tell you that true code reuse between projects in the OO world is mostly a pipe dream. That's why so many good OO guys end up being toolsmiths and writing frameworks -- out of a desperate desire to create true reusable pieces of code for common problems.

Spending countless hours every year learning yet another version of WhizBang, getting certified, trying to teach some concepts, learning some more. How many versions of database access has Microsoft offered over the years? He had an amazing ability to remember small details from hundreds of places. We usually call such ability to recall being "smart"
