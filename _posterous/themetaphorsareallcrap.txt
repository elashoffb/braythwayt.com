## The metaphors are all crap

Read this: [Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal.](http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~elf/hack/realmen.html)

And this: [Programming, Motherfucker. Do you speak it?](http://programming-motherfucker.com/)

Now step away from the quiche. Stop arguing about [whether to delimit blocks with {} or do/end](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/11/programming-conventions-as-signals.html). This is not a [team](http://raganwald.posterous.com/the-mother-of-all-interview-questions). It's not a [boat](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/11/vast-and-endless-sea.html), not [a machine that has a lot of parts of it that have to work together](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/03/spaghetti-western-coding.html).

The metaphors are all crap. This is **programming**---that's all it is.
