## I also stand up for Stallman.

He stands up for Stallman. So do I. 

No, I'll go further. I stand WITH Stallman. Do not try to say, "No, Reg, you are not like Stallman. You do not rave. You do not have some persnickety personal habit." Yes I AM like Stallman. I am human. I deserve respect. I deserve dignity. My ideas deserve to be heard and debated on their merits, not on whether I choose to fit in with whatever Old Boys Club is going on around here. If I happen to fit in right now, that's just an artefact of history, a co√Øncidence. Tomorrow I may not fit in. Not so long ago, I didn't fit in, at all, under any circumstances.

As it happens, I have never met Mr. Stallman, and my guess is that he doesn't need me standing up for him or standing with him. But that really isn't the point. This is bigger than Mr. Stallman, and it's bigger than me. It's about who WE are and what kind of world we want our children to live in.

I have a son. He gets teased and bullied in school because "He uses his imagination too much." It breaks my heart. Now, what could I tell him about this if I stood by and watched another human being get bullied? That it's not okay for kids to bully him, but it is ok for adults to bully Stallman? Or should I explain it like this: Those kids are bullying him wrongly because he is imaginative, but we're not bullying, we're just "Exercising free speech," and we're just "Being pragmatic about who should and who shouldn't speak for Free Software," and so on and so forth. 

I have a feeling he'd see right through my hypocrisy, so I'm not going to do that! I am not going to participate in disrespecting and bullying someone. I think I can stand on my record here. I don't do that. I speak out against that:

And I think I have to speak out against that, I'm compelled to speak out against that! It's not enough to sit out, to stand by and say nothing, to do nothing. There's this thing going around about bullying gay teenagers. Famous people say, "It gets better." Actually, it doesn't just "get" better. Slavery didn't just "get" better. PEOPLE made it illegal. Then PEOPLE fought for equal rights.

And it is better today, but it still isn't good enough. Today PEOPLE are making it better for LGTB teenagers. How? By standing up for them. By stepping in and saying, "No, it's not ok for you to make fun of a human being. No, it's not okay for you to laugh at a human being. No, it's not okay for you to be rude to a human being just because they don't fit in with your monoculture." 

Honestly, that behaviour is not ok. And it never has been ok. And it never will be ok. 

So please stop.
