## Something has been stolen, that's for sure

In 1971, Abbie Hoffman (with co-conspirators Izak Haber, Tom Forcade, and Bert Cohen) wrote [Steal This Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_This_Book), a subversive's how-to that featured instructions for making pipe bombs, operating guerrilla radio and television stations, shoplifting, credit card fraud, growing cannabis, and other activities that were not only illegal, but presented as ways of overthrowing the lawful government of the day.

> The writing of a book on how to commit illegal acts opened people up to new possibilities regarding their use of the first amendment, and showed how radical one's writing could be.---[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_This_Book#Cultural_response)

Was this book censored? Hoffman was unable to get anyone to publish it, so he published it himself. It became a best-seller. Nobody went to jail for writing, possessing, or distributing instructions for breaking the law, even with respect to drugs, sabotage, and personal violence.

And this was a time when such things were a practical threat. The late sixties and early seventies were a time of tremendous social upheaval. Opposition to the Vietnam War had divided America. A domestic radical organization, the [Weather Underground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Underground), had declared war against the government of the United States. It bombed police stations, customs sheds, and even the United States Capitol, broke Timothy Leary out of prison, and it would go on to bomb the Pentagon _and_ the Department of State.

And yet, the United States tolerated the dissemination of revolutionary instructions contained in "Steal This Book." It cherished the First Amendment above its own safety. That's what a value is, something you value enough to stand firm even when it costs you dearly. Although my own country has gone down a slightly different road, I admire a country that could tolerate "Steal This Book" during a time when bombs were going off within its borders.

How have we fared in the four decades since "Steal This Book" was published? Today, citizens of the United States face fines and lengthy prison terms for daring to publish or even _describe_ instructions for making fair use of information. Instructions for "circumventing" copy protection measures is contraband. Even disclosing [certain numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_number) is a crime.

In 1971, America feared that it would be destroyed by long-haired youth with bombs and drugs, but stood fast on its values and allowed Hoffman to publish instructions for carrying out the overthrow of the country by any means necessary. In 2012, America fears that its citizens will copy their own DVDs onto their own iPads to watch in bed. In 2012, America will jail citizens of any country who publish instructions for recovering a lost spreadsheet password.

Something has been stolen, that's for sure.
