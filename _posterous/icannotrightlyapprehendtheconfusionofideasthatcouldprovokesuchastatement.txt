## I cannot rightly apprehend the confusion of ideas that could provoke such a statement

_Today I welcome [Nickieben Bourbaki](http://www.dreamsongs.com/Nickieben.html) as a guest. Here are his thoughts on a recent post:_

![Confusion](images/confusion_jpg_scaled500.jpg)

Yesterday, I read an awful blog title: [I call bullshit on Computer "Science"](http://raganwald.posterous.com/i-call-bullshit-on-computer-science). The thesis of the author's rant was written in bold: **I'm calling bullshit on all claims about humans creating software. All of them. Every one.**

Having accused Computer Science of being bullshit in the title, the author went on to validate Computer Science!

> Computer Science is a Formal Science, meaning it concerns itself with the study of formal systems, much as Mathematics does. Computer Science can definitively answer questions about the nature of uncomputable problems or the length of a program that produces a certain number. Computer Science is silent on the subject of humans creating software.

And so it is. Computer Science is quite properly the study of computations and of computers. Computer Science is not a social science concerned with the behaviour of humans when given the task of composing computer programs. As many outraged readers pointed out, the study of what happens when people set out to write programs is not Computer Science, it's [Software Engineering](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Software_engineering). And more importantly, it's not a Formal Science, it isn't even a hard Empirical Science like Physics, it's a _Social Science _like [Human Factors](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Human_factors).

Social Sciences are nothing at all like Formal Sciences. They involve a tremendous amount of conjecture. They involve bodies of knowledge that are accumulations of consensus rather than theories established through rigorous experiment. Social Sciences do have empirical components to them. We can perform double blind studies, we can make surveys of the real world. That being said, some people criticize social sciences as being less valid than hard sciences like Physics. The main line of argument against social sciences is that while you can make conjectures and test them in what appears to be an empirical fashion, when you poke the conjectures and tests with a sharp stick, you find all sorts of assumptions and biases that haven't been independently tested and validated.

The author claims that we don't treat programming as an Empirical Science. Here he is wrong. Some people treat programming as a Social Science, and some of those people conduct empirical research into things like programmer productivity. There are studies going as far back as 1968. There are at least three decent books on the subject written for Industry: [Peopleware](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932633439?ie=UTF8&tag=raganwald001-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0932633439), [The Mythical Man-Month](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201835959?ie=UTF8&tag=raganwald001-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0201835959), and [Making Software](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596808321?ie=UTF8&tag=raganwald001-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596808321). The trouble is, the author is not wrong enough to dismiss his post as the ravings of an uneducated clod.

While there _are_ a few studies, there isn't enough research to make strong decisions about programming with any degree of confidence. You can read hundreds of books about programming that say that good programmers are ten times or twenty times or even more productive than poor programmers, and when you read the citations you find out that one author is quoting another who is quoting another and all the trails lead back to one or two studies, and even with the original studies in hand, nobody can agree on whether what they measure truly reflects "productivity" on non-trivial programming projects.

What appears on the surface to be a consensus amongst the Software Engineering community about an important problem like programmer productivity is an illusion, the result of confusing echoes with agreement. The original "facts" have become [folklore](http://blog.institut-agile.fr/2010/11/folklore-ou-fait-scientifique-comment.html), they have been stripped of their original caveats and controls.

Software Engineering needs to do a lot more research. Software Engineering needs to repeat more of the existing research while eliminating various possible other factors so that we can have some confidence that there is a discrepancy between different types of programmers and that other factors like tools, methods, or environment are not responsible for differences in productivity. Software Engineering needs some skeptics, researchers who set out to invalidate existing research with the same enthusiasm that went into the original claims. The only claims we can adopt with confidence are the ones that have successfully withstood repeated attempts to disprove them.

Another problem is that the programming field is advancing at the speed of thought, but the empirical research is crawling along too slowly to be relevant to questions practitioners are asking. It's great that we know something about whether interruptions affect outcomes as measured by defects on small, well-defined tasks. But we need to be able to reach a true consensus on questions like whether [OOP is being practiced backwards](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2010/12/oop.md#readme) or not. Where is the Software Engineering framework for unambiguously stating this as a conjecture and performing experiments to validate or invalidate the hypothesis?

Programmers today are concerned with higher-level problems than lines of code. How should programs be organized? Is enforcing constraints by means of type-checking a win? Is it a win for types to be inferred? Or is it a win for programs to document their intention with manifest type declarations? How does one define productivity? Are there real differences between programmers and if so, can they be measured? Is testing a programmer valid?

We need solid research into methods, paradigms, practices, and every other decision that programmers make when composing programs. Until Software Engineering does more research validating or invalidating the results it has already obtained, and until Software Engineering does more research into answering questions that current practicing programmers are asking, there will be a confusion of ideas in the broad programming community.

The author closed his post with the following outrageous claim:

> Until we start treating programming as an Empirical Science, what we have are superstitions and mass hallucinations. They might be comforting and somewhat consistent hallucinations, but when it comes to writing software, our beliefs are almost all equivalent to the belief that [waving palm fronds in the air will summon airplanes](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Cargo_cult_science).

Well, the author may be wrong about whether there is or isn't original, empirical research into the social science of programming. But is he really wrong about whether the programming community as a whole is making decisions based on superstitions?

That may not be the word I would choose when trying to coax someone into reading the research that exists, but I cannot deny that the industry as a whole makes its choices on the basis of folklore, on "knowledge" that is passed on from study to book to blog post to comment on reddit to tweet like parables passed on from one generation of a tribe to the next.

Given this environment, I can easily comprehend the confusion of ideas that would provoke the suggestion that programming as practiced in industry is a [Cargo Cult Science](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Cargo_cult_science), not even a Social Science, and certainly not a hard Empirical Science like Physics.
