## Why The Fuck?

Why the fuck are the greatest minds of our generation toiling away in the Googleplex, harnessing the greatest computing resources in history, trying to figure out how to get Scott Hanselman to click on ads?

Why the fuck are programers strategizing how to pivot Facebook into being a dating site?

Why the fuck is everybody and his brother trying to remix the same five or six tired "social" ideas in the hope of being acqui-hired to toil in the bowels of Google or Facebook?

Why the fuck is Apple using its expertise as the greatest manufacturer of easy-to-use computing power to get us to switch from 3.5" screens to 4" screens?

**Why the fuck** is everyone doing all this useless busy-work, when what Scott really needs is to manage his blood sugar with the second-by-second efficiency. Without pain or hassle.

Diabetes. Overweight. These are real problems, affecting real people, that need real solutions, even if they don't sound glamorous when writing a Â "Show HN" post.
