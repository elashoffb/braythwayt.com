## An open letter to Google with respect to their new privacy policy and SPYW

Dear Google:

Please don't buy any more interesting Internet startups. Instead, create your own and let the market decide if they want to do business with you. I don't, and I don't want to do business with someone else and wake up one morning to discover that thanks to a huge war-chest of buyout money, your tanks and jackboots have marched into their offices.

**Do not buy Dropbox. Don't even think about buying Github.** Don't buy _anything_ I use. Please. I beg of you. Why?

Well, you have two models for acquisitions. First, you do a "talent acquisition" and shutter the service. I lose. Second, you "integrate" the service into your offerings. I lose even more. Let me explain. Imagine you buy Github. Your busy beavers migrate its infrastructure into your infrastructure, and now I can sign into Github with my Google profile. What does this mean to me?

Well, it means that the profile you are accumulating for me contains all of my public repositories, and so when I am reading email, you can decide to show me advertisements for JavaScript books or some such. I can live with that. What I can't live with is this: When I'm reading email, you show me advertisements for things that are relevant to my _private_ repositories. So for example, if I am working on a client project, now you get to scrape that information, all of the documents and use cases, and forever associate them with me. You get to use that to make my ads more "relevant." And my search. And you tell me that I "win."

I don't see this as winning. Those repositories are _private_. I pay Github to have private repositories, I don't trade privacy for a "free" service. You buying Github would mean my moving everything private away to another service of some kind. Mere _rumours_ of you buying Github would mean me moving private repositories away from Github. Same thing for Dropbox: I have a lot of _private_ documents in there. The thought of you scraping those documents so you can sell my "eyeballs" to the highest bidder gives me the willies.

It's not just client work, of course, it's private projects, unstarted startups, everything I want kept close to my chest. I happily pay for Dropbox and Github, in part because I don't want them falling into your clutches.

So. Please, keep off. **Stay the hell away from the services I trust.**

Thanks in advance for your attention to my request.

Signed,

Reginald Scott Braithwaite

p.s. I apologise for the open letter. You know, and I know, and everybody else knows, that "open" letters are actually written to the crowd, not to the nominal recipient. Mea Culpa!
