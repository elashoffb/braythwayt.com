## Hiring a Nanny

Imagine, if you will, that you are hiring a Nanny. You have limited resources, of course, and every dollar you pay to the Nanny is a dollar that doesn't go onto your children's dinner plate, a dollar that doesn't support the roof over their heads, and a dollar that doesn't further their education. Let's say you decide to treat this as a business transaction. You look for an "acceptable" candidate that will work for as little money as possible relative to his or her "competition" for the job you are offering.

One day the wind changes sharply, and you interview a candidate, I will call her "Mary." Things go well until you talk money. Mary agrees that there are many candidates out there that are willing to meet your minimum standards for child care at varying rates of pay. The market is inefficient, you cannot unequivocally state that paying less gets you poorer child care. However, she points out that a larger budget does give you access to a larger pool of candidates and that many of them---herself included---can and will offer superior child care to the candidates who are willing to work for less.

Fair enough, you are not stupid and you knew that already. You're juggling a number of priorities for your children and you can't spend the maximum on everything, even though you sincerely want the best of the best across the board. But now Mary makes a point: "If you have two identical pairs of jeans, and you are able to get one pair on sale, it looks just as good and wears just as well as the pair purchased at full price. Jeans are objects. But people are different. They make judgments based on all sorts of things, including value judgments about your priorities. And childcare is not a product being purchased, it is a service relationship."

She pauses and looks at you pointedly.

"If you announce that your children's child care is not worth top dollar to you, and for  that matter not even worth the market median dollar, what kind of service do you expect from your new Nanny? If you don't value your children's child care highly, why would a Nanny who values her services want to put them to work in a household where her services are not considered vital to the children's future?"

You stammer that you are interviewing thoroughly and will only hire a Nanny who will do excellent work regardless of salary. Mary sniffs. "Things said in an interview are pie crust promises: Easily made, easily broken. In any event, I have decided that this household is entirely unsuitable. We need not waste any further time together." And with that, she leaves, taking her parrot-head umbrella and carpet bag with her.

I think about this basic problem every time I am exposed to an employer who is looking to hire talent at an economical rate. I sympathize, we can't pay top dollar for everything and build a sustainable business. Furthermore, markets are inefficient and there is such a thing as a bargain employee.

Nevertheless, what we pay signals what we value. If we set out to pay as little as possible to employ the minimally "acceptable" candidate, we necessarily select employees from a smaller pool in part because our price signal turns away candidates who aren't necessarily venal, but want to work where their work is valued. And worst of all, we risk employing people who work only to avoid being fired. That is not good, not good at all.

Much to think about in this basic problem. But if you'll excuse me, I have a rooftop assignation with some chimney sweeps...
