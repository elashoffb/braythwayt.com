## For Scott Hanselman

A King toured a monastery. He liked what he saw, and after a quiet and stimulating conversation with the senior monks, he asked the Abbott to write him something auspicious. The Abbott got out his calligraphy pen and a scroll. After fixing the King with his gaze for a moment, he wrote three characters: 

Father dies.   
Man dies.   
Son dies. 

The King was aghast: "What is this? It is most inauspicious to wish death upon the men of my family!" 

The Abbot was serene. "Oh King," he chided, "Death comes to us all, it is foolish to wish anything else. Would it not be inauspicious for these things to happen in any other order?" The King bowed his head. "I was rash," he admitted, "I should have contemplated what you wrote until I found the realization for myself."
