The discussion is not about you or I recognizing or not recognizing a marriage, it is about the government recognizing or not recognizing a marriage. Here in Ontario, we don't have special marriages for people of the same sex. We don't call it "gay marriage." There are no special privileges.

It's just marriage.

As for being forced to hire people in contravention of your religious beliefs... You are going to have to go your way and me go mine. I live in Ontario, where employers are not forced to hire homosexuals, they're forced to hire employees on the basis of their qualifications and not on the basis of discrimination that is irrelevant to whether they can or cannot do the job.

The [Ontario Human Rights Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Human_Rights_Code) was enacted into legislation the day after I was born (yay me!). It doesn't create special privileged classes. It says nothing about quotas or reverse discrimination or any other unfair apportionment of opportunities. It simply prevents the creation of second-class citizens. The very notion of a second-class citizen is antithetical to my beliefs and the beliefs of my fellow Canadians.

The beliefs your post espouses speak to a man's freedom to keep another man down by virtue of his religious choices. You say that his freedom to practice discrimination is more important than another man's freedom to an equal chance of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In theory this sounds very nice, but in practice such so-called freedoms have historically always resulted in mass oppression, not freedom.

The post whines about the creation of privileged classes, as if we are being dragged further and further away from a world where a man could not hire a woman simply because he didn't want to, or direct all blacks down the hall to custodial services. Your post is correct about that, we are going away from that world, and as far as [my mother](http://raganwald.posterous.com/a-womans-story) is concerned, the sooner the better.

Here, we believe that where "freedom" is concerned, that in theory there is no difference between theory and practice, but in practice, there is. The bottom line is that I am not asking for a new class of marriages, or a new class of workers, or a new class of citizens. Just the opposite.

I'm asking for us to tear down the distinction between straight and gay, between cisgendered and transgendered, between black and white, between catholic and protestant, between male and female, between old and young, between married and single, and everything else not relevant to commerce. We can do whatever we want in our homes and our clubs and our places of worship.

But where we employ people, let us simply employ **people**. Where we marry people, let us marry people. Where we teach people, let us teach people. It's that simple. It's just marriage, because they're just people.
