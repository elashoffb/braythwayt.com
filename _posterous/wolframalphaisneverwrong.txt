## Wolfram Alpha is never wrong

Stephen Wolfram is giving a talk at a startup and technology conference. It is well received, and afterwards he is crowded by well-wishers. The next speaker, Professor Ackerman, is an academic with a long and distinguished career in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. He proceeds to criticize [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/).

"While amusing, Wolfram Alpha cannot answer complex questions based on limited information. Here's an example of the kind of thing it cannot even attempt to answer."

Ackerman opens Wolfram Alpha in a browser, and while the audience watches on the big screen, laboriously types a question, **What is my father doing right now?**

The system thinks and thinks for a great while. "Ah" the professor smirks, "stumped it!" At long last, there is a result:

"Balderdash," the professor exclaims. "The system has gotten confused. Fly fishing? My father died on New Year's Day, 1998!"

Stephen Wolfram cannot contain himself. He stands up and climbs on stage. "Ackerman," he interrupts, "[Rule 110](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Rule_110) is that Wolfram Alpha is never wrong. Let me show you." Wolfram elbows Ackerman aside while the crowd madly tweets and videos the rumpus. He smoothly types: **Which of Ackerman's relations died January 1, 1998?**

** **The answer is almost immediate:

"You see," says Wolfram with satisfaction, "You need to know how to ask the right question. **Your mother's husband died on New Year's Day, 1998. Your father, on the other hand, is fly fishing right now.**"
