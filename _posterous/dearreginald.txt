## Dear Reginald

[So it goes. So it goes.](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/10/05/steve)

And indeed, he is gone forever. As you will be one day, and that day is coming ever sooner, relentlessly closer. Your own life may end tomorrow. It may end in seven years when you are also 56. It may end in a frustratingly short couple of decades when you are in your sixties, seventies, or maybe even eighties. But you too will have to [say your good-byes](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html).

Your life will also be composed of the choices you make. One of them is before you now. This man died. He had an impact on your life. You are tempted to eulogize him, to try to explain what his choices meant to your life. How he was a part of a tidal wave of technological and social change This is natural, it is part of grief, an attempt to make sense of death and to imbue this moment with meaning.

But Reginald, stop for a moment. Think. What do you admire about this man? His ability to say no. His ability to ignore the things that don't matter. His ability to make important choices. You have a choice now, a choice to invest your time in connecting yourself to him though mourning, or a chance to go out and do something else.

Admiration is good when it inspires, when it motivates. But there's another thing, deification, where your admiration and wonder at another human being go to the point where you believe that they are a God, while you are insignificant. When this happens, you identify with them by worshiping their good qualities rather than emulating them. You do not seek to act as they acted, instead you seek to immerse yourself in their actions, to connect yourself with them through the ritual of reading their words or recounting stories about them.

Deification undermines action, but admiration _inspires_ action. So admire him, but don't deify him. Remember the words of another man who is still very much alive:

> when you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. your tastes only narrow & exclude people. so create.

If you wish to honour a dead man's legacy, you will define yourself by the things you create, rather than by your taste in people and the things _they_ create. Admire the man who is gone. But don't deify him. Take inspiration and act, don't spend your time in worship. Your moment of grief is over. That man is dead. You are alive.

So create.
