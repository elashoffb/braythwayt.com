## Pick your poison

> Pick your poison: pick one idea and stick with it for a year or two, or do the micro-startup idea thing I did for a while where you develop something new every couple of weeks.

> Whatever you do, don't fall into the death zone. Don't "fall in love" with an idea, screw around with it for 4-6 months, then give up. That's the worst of both worlds: you've picked something and stayed with it long enough to get really emotionally attached, yet you haven't given it the attention it needs to actually grow (or die). Then when you finally switch to something new, it comes as a failure.
