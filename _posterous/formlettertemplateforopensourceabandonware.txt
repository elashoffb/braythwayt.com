Dear soon-to-be-former user,

As you know, I've poured my hear and soul into this:

[ ] Free-as-in-speech  
[ ] Free-as-in-beer

[ ] Tool  
[ ] Library   
[ ] Repository  
[ ] Other: _________________

While you and many like you:

[ ] Leeched without lifting a finger to help  
[ ] Whined about how your pet issue wasn't addressed   
[ ] Indulged your need for drama  
[ ] Treated me like a combination serf and village idiot  
[ ] Other: _________________

Well, I've got some fantastic news!  Well, it's great news for me anyway.  You, on   
the other hand, are fucked.

I've just:

[ ] Founded a startup  
[ ] Found a paying job   
[ ] Realized life is too short for handling your entitlement issues  
[ ] Other: _________________

And I no longer have the time or inclination to maintain this fine work.

I tried transitioning this to other maintainers, however:

[ ] None of the leeches could be bothered to respond  
[ ] None of the people bitching about their pet issues responded  
[ ] None of the drama queens could agree on who was worthy to respond  
[ ] Other: _________________

Therefore, effective:

[ ] A week ago, didn't you notice?  
[ ] Immediately  
[ ] When I get around to it

I will be closing everything down and wiping it from the Internet forever.

Your personal contributions, if any, will be gone with it. I am not  
worried that I am destroying something critical to your future. After all,  
if it was that important to you, you would have helped out more while it  
was around.

Sincerely yours,
