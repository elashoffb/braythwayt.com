## Bias

As you may know, I frequent a few public forums on the internet. One common theme that comes up in discussions is the question of bias on the part of an author or commenter. One of the most obvious examples is John Gruber, author of [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net). Many people feel that he is extremely pro-Apple, and that being an Apple enthusiast colours his opinion on Apple and many related subjects. Some go a step further than merely believing in his bias: They suggest that his words on any subject related to Apple or a business Apple is in are somehow less valuable than the words of someone with no apparent bias.

Is this a valid concern? Should we discount the opinions of someone who appears to be biased? Many people prefer that arguments be put forth from a neutral point of view. I call this the faux-academic tradition: Arguments are stated dispassionately and being careful to point out both pros and cons. An argument that is heavily weighted towards pro- or con- without giving proper consideration to the opposing point of view is defective. I disagree with this idea in the context of a discussion or when reading opinions on the Internet. Here's why.

Let's start by asking ourselves, what are we trying to accomplish in a discussion? I suggest that we are trying to come up with all the pros and cons, to identify all of the relevant issues. Imagine, for a moment, that we are discussing some course of action, say whether to develop software for some platform. Let's label the people in the discussion as optimists (they are biased in favour), pessimists (they are biased against), and pragmatists (they have no bias on this subject).

Imagine you are reading this discussion. If I gave you a filter that would hide the comments by the optimists and pessimists, leaving only the pragmatists, would the conversation have more value thanks to filtering out "noise?" Or would it have less value? I suggest that it would have less value, because an optimist might have an idea or suggestion that none of the pragmatists picked up. This shouldn't surprise anyone, optimists are optimistic, and while they may gloss over the drawbacks, they are interested in the advantages. Likewise, a pessimist may have an important observation to make about a pitfall of proceeding that none of the pragmatists caught. Again, no surprise. The pessimists are the ones most likely to exhaustively study the drawbacks and risks of moving forward.

Put it like this, do we need the pragmatists? I conjecture we do, because while I think the optimists and the pessimists are going to give us all the reasons for and against, the pragmatists will do a good job of weighing one against the other. So each group has something positive to bring to a discussion. Overall, we benefit from having optimists, pessimists, and pragmatists contributing to the discussion. The same thing is true when reading opinions on the Internet. We benefit from reading a wide range of opinions, and we benefit from reading those that are optimistic, pessimistic, and pragmatic.

For this reason, I do not ignore the question of whether an author is biased or not. But I do not disqualify the author's opinions. Just the opposite: When I am aware that an author is consistently biased, I seek their words out. By reading a "portfolio" of opinions on a subject that includes authors biased for, against, or neutral, I get the fullest spectrum of ideas, argument, and perspectives.

I think that's a win, and that's why I suggest that while we note bias on the part of an author or participant in a discussion, we shouldn't discount their words. Instead, we should cherish them as contributing a valuable point of view.
