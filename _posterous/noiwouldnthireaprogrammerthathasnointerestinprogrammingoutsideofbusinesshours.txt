## No, I Wouldn't Hire a Programmer That Has No Interest in Programming Outside of Business Hours

_(The following originally appeared on [Homoiconic](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/). I've moved it here because, frankly, it isn't code-centric and it's not the kind of thing that absolutely, positively needs to live forever on my own server. If Posterous ever goes away, I won't mourn the loss of these words. That doesn't mean they weren't valuable for me to write or to contemplate, just that they aren't the same kind of thing as words about combinators or rewriting Ruby or what Git tells us about programming languages.)_

I read this on [proggit](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9s3ww/would_you_hire_a_programmer_that_does_not_write/):

> A while ago my company interviewed someone who, in the course of some standard question, said that after the 5 o'clock whistle blows, they avoid computers totally. They don't have any hobbies involving their PC and often don't turn it on unless they are expecting an important email or need to look up directions. I followed up to ask how they got into programming and they said they took the right courses in college and now has had a few jobs doing it.

> Would you hire a software engineer who isn't a hobbyist programmer? What if they avoid computers totally at home? Does it matter if a candidate has strictly a professional interest in software and just pretends it doesn't exist outside the office?

Here's another way to frame this question: Would I even _interview_ a programmer who only works their programming job from 9-5? If not, why not?

The answer is remarkably simple. No, I would not interview them, for the simple reason that I don't know who they are and they don't know who I am. When I am hiring, my first and best source of prospective colleagues is my network. Industry people I know. Where do I get to know people? Conferences. Open source. Blogging. Twitter. I don't advertise my job openings on [monster.com](http://monster.com). So how did this person come to sit in front of me to tell me he(?) pretends software doesn't exist outside of the office?

I think you have to align your values with your complete hiring process, not just with your interview questions. If you value people who are passionate about their craft, you have to use a different means of selecting prospects than if you value having warm bodies sitting in chairs. If you want a warm body with a certain minimal competence in a chair, you use [monster.com](http://monster.com) and recruiters to find people. if you value community and craft, you use your network and your community.

Done this way, questions like the above tend to take care of themselves.

_Update August 16, 2010_:

If you read the above article closely, it never says that someone who does not involve themselves in programming outside of business hours is not competent or not passionate. It simply says that I use a certain method of getting to know people (call this MY_PEEPS) which in my anecdotal experience leads to a satisfactory number of candidates who have certain competences I desire when hiring (call these SKILLZ). Why do I desire them? Because in my anecdotal experience, a small team with SKILLZ ships SOFTWARE. So my experience is that:

(MY_PEEPScandidate ⇒ SKILLZcandidate) ∧ (SKILLZteam ⇒ SOFTWAREteam)

I stand by the above, however I think we can all agree that:

¬(¬MY_PEEPScandidate ⇒ ¬SKILLZcandidate) ∧ ¬(¬SKILLZteam ⇒ ¬SOFTWAREteam)

Or more simply (thanks, [riffraff](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1611275). Loved you in Dark City!):

¬(SKILLZcandidate ⇒ MY_PEEPScandidate ∨ SOFTWAREteam ⇒ SKILLZteam)

Also---and I think this would be laugh-out-loud-funny if it wasn't so personally painful---I rarely attend conferences or networking events unless I am invited to give a presentation or participate in a workshop or are otherwise manoevered into some other tangible and explicit commitment. Why? I have social anxiety, and while I am stimulated in an incredibly rich and rewarding way when I meet and talk to people I like and admire, when there are more than a few people in the room I feel incredibly uncomfortable and have to fight the urge to slide out.

The irony of using networking in my career when I'm deathly afraid of one of the most important methods of networking is not lost on me, I can only hope you understand that I am not being hypocritical. Even if it makes me uncomfortable, it works well.

_Update August 17, 2010_:

Criticism: **The title is bunkum**. It happens to refer to the reddit question that sparked my thoughts, however taken out of context it seems to suggest that I woud refuse to hire a programmer that has no interest in programming outside of business hours, which is not the same thing as suggesting that I would be unlikely to meet them in the first place. That being said, many of my networking activities can be carried out during business hours, so the title and the article don't stand up to rigorous examination. Nevertheless, the underlying message is straightforward, namely that my strategy for finding teammates involves certain typs of Internet and physical networking activities.

Criticism: **The post fails to mention that a strategy for meeting good people is not a metric for deciding whether someone is good**. The logic is fairly obvious, and my update from yesterday tries to explain this, however this is a deeply personal subject and I think it's my responsibility to be sure that I am clear about something, not just write potentially inflammatory things and then when readers get upset accuse them of failing at reading comprehension or logical clarity.

I believe this last point so strongly that I've blathered on about it in [another post](http://raganwald.posterous.com/all-that-jazz).
