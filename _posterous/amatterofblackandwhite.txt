## A Matter of Black and White

Imagine, if you will, a group of zealous anti-CoffeeScripters. They hate the CoffeeScript style and the way it pollutes otherwise "pure" JavaScript projects and JavaScript communities.

They are paranoid and angry. When JavaScript programmers try CoffeeScript, they are accused of being "Script Traitors." The zealots say they aren't anti-CoffeeScript, they simply have "JavaScript Pride."

Consider Mr. Reg Braithwaite. He writes many of his blog posts in both JavaScript and CoffeeScript. When he works on a JavaScript project, he generally leaves it in JavaScript. If he starts a new project, he considers the style of programming and chooses JavaScript of CoffeeScript accordingly. He has written a [CoffeeScript book](http://leanpub.com/coffeescript-ristretto).

One day he shows up at a JavaScript meetup. The zealots mutter angrily: "Get the CoffeeScriptor outta here! Let him go to meetups with his own kind!!" Mr. Braithwaite is unmoved.

"I'm a JavaScript programmer. Let us get on with the WildÂ JavaScript Rumpus."

The zealots are outraged. "If you have one drop of CoffeeScript blood, you're a CoffeeScripter! You have the arrow culture! You have the brace-free look! You do that wild jungle indentation dancing!!"

But they are wrong. Mr. Braithwaite is inclusive, he is a CoffeeScript programmer AND a JavaScript programmer. The "single drop of blood" doctrine is nonsense. These people are blinded by ignorance and a desire to hate an enemy.

In a similar vein, I can tell you that Mr. Braithwaite is proud to call himself a White Canadian. And proud to call himself a Black Canadian. Why not? He has a White Father. He listens to Rush. He plays Hockey. He also has a Black Mother. He listens to P-Funk. He dances the Freak.

He identifies with more than one culture. And also, why not? He lives in a country with two official languages, a country that embraces multi-culturalism. And he takes that multicultural, inclusive perspective to his programming philosophies.

He seeks more than just a world of many people of different backgrounds working together. He seeks a world where each person integrates many points of views, cultures, and experiences.

He is a multi-cultural man, and an unapologetic polyglot programmer. And he's not just an addict, he's also a pusher.

It's a matter of black AND white.
