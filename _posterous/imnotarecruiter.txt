## I'm not a recruiter

**I just want to remind certain folks that I'm not a recruiter. I always try to make introductions, but the people offering me money for leads are wasting their time. Neither my integrity nor my address book are for sale, and if you want to meet developers for your startup, then you'll have to find a way to become less busy when developers are attending local meetups and hackathons.**

(Snarfed from Pete Forde. This isn't really a "post," it's a little something I'm saving so that whenever I receive a certain type of email, I can either copy and paste the text or---if I'm feeling especially lazy---I can simply forward a link to this page in reply. Feel free to use it in exactly the same way.)
