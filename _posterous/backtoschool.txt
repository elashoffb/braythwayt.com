## Back to school

It seems that a medical researcher has re-discovered the [trapezoidal rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule) for estimating integrals. People do this all the time. The procedure is this: Someone is doing some work, is ignorant of existing research in the field, and re-invents something that is already well-known. In this case, The researcher received an online raspberry because the work she re-invented is taught in High School calculus, and she chose to name her re-invention after herself.

**Stand back! I know Calculus!!**

I personally wouldn't criticize someone for this. I could get all humble with you and say that it's because I'm aware of my own frailties, but I don't really believe that people without sin should cast the first stone. I have made many mistakes, and that hasn't held me back from speaking my mind yet.

The reason I wouldn't criticize her is that I doubt that writing a sneeringly condescending post will change anything in the medical community. It's more of a frat boys getting together and laughing at someone kind of thing. Distasteful, but full of jollies for the in crowd. 

**I _will_ point fingers elsewhere. I read about the entire mess on Hacker News. The comments were [disheartening](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1964613). Joining in on the pillorying of the researcher is to be expected. It's human nature, and there is no shorter road to disappointment than expecting human beings to somehow stop acting like human beings, especially in a social situation.**

**The missing voice in all of this is my own. I passed on having anything to do with the subject when the link was first posted, and I regret that now. The conversation is missing a vital subject: _What are programmers reinventing on a daily basis?_**

**_Medical research, step aside. If you want to know how to re-invent things out of ignorance of past research, sit at our feet and learn from programmers. Programmers reinvent Lisp so often there's a [rule of law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun's_Tenth_Rule) to describe the process. And once they learn Lisp, do they don't stop there? No! They boldly [re-invent monads](http://kevin.scaldeferri.com/blog/2008/01/26/RaganwaldReinventsMonads.html) and take credit for their insights._**

**_Read about the Ruby language. You can find thousands of [smug programmers](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/06/what-does-do-when-used-as-unary.html) who will explain how Ruby's blocks and its yield keyword make programming a delight. But if you ask them to explain [coroutines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine), you get a blank state and a furious tapping away to search Google for the word. (This is the problem with programmers who say they can search for the answer to any programming question on Google: How do you know what question to ask?)_**

**_I think we have better things to do than to lament the education of medical researchers. There was much talk of wasted effort in research and poor peer review. _****_ I think we need to clean up our own house, now. And when we find something like this, we should use it as motivation to redouble our efforts. The programming community needs to go back to school and stay there until it stops wasting billions of dollars of lost time reinventing things through ignorance._**
