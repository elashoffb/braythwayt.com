## With Respect to Matters Concerning The Board of Directors of Hewlett-Packard and their Selection and Governance of Chief Executive Officers

A manager named Léo finds himself a new job. He'll be running an established company that needed to replace Mark, their star CEO. Mark got himself fired for a few expense irregularities once he'd done the board's dirty work of cutting costs and goosing the stock price. 

  
When Léo walks into to his new office, Mark is clearing out his desk. "I'll only be a minute. By the way, I have something for you" says Mark. Léo looks thoughtfully at the two envelopes Mark hands him. The first envelope is labeled "Open when in trouble." The second is labeled "Open when in even more trouble." Léo tucks them away and heads off to his first press conference.

Léo is really busy his first few months. He's a business guy, but Mark bought a consumer company that is bleeding cash. And while its products are much beloved, nobody is spending any actual _money_ on them. He decides to give them one more chance, and if their next release isn't a home run, cut them loose. Alas, their next release is steamrollered in the market, and Leo Léo announces he's closing them down.

Well!

Instead of gratitude for making a painful but necessary decision, he faces an employee revolt. The press is roasting him for not giving them a chance, and the stock price is gyrating like a crackhead with St. Vitus' Dance. Nobody seems to listen when he shows them the buggy software that customers refuse to buy. Instead, they talk about how it'll be great Real Soon Now, a real Contender, and how come he lacks the technical chops to run this place?

The board calls an emergency meeting to discuss his management, and Léo remembers the envelopes. He opens the one marked "Open when in trouble," and inside he finds a postcard from a trip Mark took with his executive assistant to Vegas. Inscribed on the card are just two words: _Blame me_.

Léo is no fool, he puts together a killer PowerPoint explaining how Mark gutted the company's R&D budget to make the numbers, and as much as Léo would like to bring out new products that will take over massive consumer markets, Mark's actions have made that impossible.

Léo lays out a plan for growth through acquisition, and the board eats it up. Léo goes out and buys a huge services company. The price is high, but the board agrees this is the right thing to do and promises they'll back him. At the press conference announcing the acquisition, Léo is all smiles.

Unfortunately, the press is not all smiles, and neither is the company. The stock falls _again_. The board calls an emergency meeting, but Léo isn't even invited. His phone rings. Before he answers it, Léo opens the next envelope, the one marked "Open when in even more trouble." Inside, Mark has left him a flyer for a vacation resort, with a voucher for a long week-end complete with spa services.

In the margin, Mark's handwriting is quite readable: _[Cercner gjb rairybcrf](http://rot13.com/index.php?text=Cercner%20gjb%20rairybcrf)._
