## This is how the Internet works

Friction is the energy lost to entropy when moving parts rub against each other. The beauty of the Internet is that it eliminates moving parts and takes the friction away from those that remain. Sometimes this produces awesome and socially transformative effects like Wikipedia, MIT courseware available online, eBay creating an entirely new category of small business, or Apple and Amazon destroying the retail music and movie businesses.

Removing friction also makes annoying things like Spam and content farms possible. And sometimes it produces amusing side effects like the following email. I receive a few of these every month:

> Good Morning,

I am  Augustine Tett and i contact to know if you sell Paving--Bricks.Can you get me a quote for the specifications below
>

Coverage:17 per m

Why is Mr. Tett approaching a stranger over the Internet about buying 400 paving bricks? Does he need 400 paving bricks (a quantity easily purchased from a garden or home improvement centre)? Is this the bait for an elaborate 419 scheme of some kind? Who knows, I only imagine that he is blasting  this out to tens or hundreds of thousands of people, and while the response rate is minuscule, his costs are even more so.

And why me? I suspect it's because a Google search for "bricks" will eventually lead to this essay of mine: [Bricks](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/08/bricks.html). Perhaps Mr. Tett is really a script of some kind toiling around the clock looking for email addresses associated with web pages about bricks.

It's amazing what happens when you take the friction out of a system. I'm impressed with the people who can look at a network and predict the rise of eBay. I'm even more impressed by people who can look at web search and predict emails like this.
