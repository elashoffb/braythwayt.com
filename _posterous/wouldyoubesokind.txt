## Would you be so kind?

I have a request. If you can help me with this, I would be extremely grateful.

As you might know from my [home page](http://reginald.braythwayt.com), I've been a main and/or keynote speaker at major Canadian events like [RubyFringe](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/braithwaite-rewrite-ruby), [MeshU](http://www.meshconference.com/meshu/), [Stack Overflow DevDays](http://blog.techscene.ca/2009/10/24/in-review-stack-overflow-dev-days-toronto/), Microsoft Tech Days, [CUSEC](http://2010.cusec.net/11-18/reg-braithwaite-thinker-extraordinaire/), and more. I've also attended a few US-based conferences like [Lightweight Languages 2](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/01/where-were-you-on-saturday-november-9.html), StartupSchool, and WWDC. 

I do get invitations to attend and/or speak at conferences from time to time, and I'd like to participate in more events south of the 49th parallel, thus I am applying for some INA/DHS paperwork to make it easier to cross the border to contribute to conferences as a speaker or guest. One of the things that is very helpful in these things is a collection of letters attesting to the value I could/would bring to a conference as a speaker, panellist, or attendee.

If you would like to see me at a programming conference in the United States in the near future, I would very much appreciate a letter stating that you feel I would be an asset to the conference. If you'd like some help composing a letter, please get in touch with me.

It would be especially helpful if _any_ of the following apply:

1. Host or organize US-based programming or startup conferences and would like to have me attend and/or speak.

2. Are a researcher in academia or business.

3. Are a manager or other "titled" employee in academia or business.

4. Possess an advanced degree (e.g. PhD or MBA).

5. Are a founder of or an investor in a startup.

If you are able to take a few minutes to put a letter together for me, please contact me by email ([raganwald@gmail.com](mailto:raganwald@gmail.com)) or call me at (416) 890-8734.

Thank you very much in advance!
