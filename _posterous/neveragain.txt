## Never Again

This morning, while waiting for the local grille to prepare my eggs, I opened the newspaper. Two stories on facing pages caught my eye. One remarked on the recent apology for the killings on [Bloody Sunday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_(1972)) in 1972. British troops shot or ran down twenty-six unarmed protesters, killing thirteen immediately and another who succumbed to his injuries later. On the facing page, I read of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the bombing of [Air India Flight 182](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Bombing), the deadliest aviation mass murder in history until eclipsed by the events of 9/11.

Although not all will agree with my view, I regard both as terrorist incidents, meaning, both were part of a campaign by one group of people to impose their political will on another group through the use of terror or fear on civilians. I'm not an expert on Northern Ireland or the movement to create an independent Khalistan. I identify more closely with incidents like the killings at [Kent State](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_shootings) in 1970, with the murders of Mike Clark and [Fred Hampton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hampton) in 1969, and with the bombing of the [16th Street Baptist Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_Street_Baptist_Church_bombing) in 1963.

We in Canada and our friends in the United States have rightly stood up and declared a "War on Terrorism." It is unacceptable to bomb an aircraft, or a church. It is unacceptable to try to advance your view on society or politics by killing civilians. Period. To prevent this, many have agreed that the loss of a little liberty is an appropriate price to pay for a little safety. I won't belabour the point by quoting Benjamin Franklin. My point is that there is another kind of terrorism, the terrorism of an army firing on unarmed protesters. The terrorism of police shooting an activist as he lays in his bed. Even illegal wiretaps and searches without warrants are a kind of terrorism, creating a fear that everything you do or say or think is being watched by people who themselves are not being watched or restrained.

I say "Never Again" to those groups of extremists who would undermine our freedom through creating fear and terror. But I also say "Never again" to those who would misuse the tools of power---the police, the armed forces, and CSIS---to undermine our freedom through creating fear and terror amongst our own citizens. But when we're asked to give up our freedom in the name of stopping terrorism, I pause only to ask that we not trade one kind of terror for another.
