## Divide et Impera

Mr. Ballmer, this is [Reg Braithwaite](http://reginald.braythwayt.com), the blogger formerly known as Raganwald. [Joey DeVilla](http://www.joeydevilla.com/), your evangelist up here in Canada said you could give me five minutes of your time to answer three quick questions for my blog. Is now a good time to talk? Thanks! 

_First question_: Name your top three competitors.

**Google, Apple, Oracle**. Thanks!

_Second question_: How did you feel when two of those three, Apple and Google, [went to war with each other](http://daringfireball.net/2010/03/napalm_in_the_morning)?

Can I just put "_Laughing your ass off?_" Ok I will, thanks.

Third question: I see that [Oracle is now suing Google](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38684074/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/). What? No, this is not a hoax. Really it isn't. No, it is neither April 1st nor Christmas, and I have no idea if it's your birthday. 

Shall I just put down "_Delighted at the news?"_
