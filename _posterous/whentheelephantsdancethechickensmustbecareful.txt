## When the elephants dance, the chickens must be careful

Jeff Bezos, as quoted in [Amazon's New Kindles](http://daringfireball.net/2011/09/amazons_new_kindles):

> There are two types of companies: those that work hard to charge customers more, and those that work hard to charge customers less. Both approaches can work. We are firmly in the second camp.

If Apple is an elephant with a business building tablets people want to own, and Amazon is an elephant with a business selling content people want to enjoy on their tablets, where does this leave chickens like Samsung and Motorola, companies that are trying to compete on price without a secondary revenue model to subsidize them? Never mind competing with Apple on price, _how do they compete with Amazon on price?_

Up to now, their business plans have all been about how they'll be able to beat Apple, Real Soon Now. They've been busy trying to [mimic](http://i.imgur.com/TmUj2.jpg) Apple's look, feel, and retail stores. Which one of these companies has a strategic plan for dealing with Amazon's pricing model and distribution? Which one of these CEOs went to their board and confidently predicted victory in a war against not one, but _two _formidable adversaries?

With much love to P.J. O'Rourke:

> Apple is the company that that says paying good money for a tablet will make you smarter, taller, richer, and remove the crabgrass on your lawn. The Android chickens say their tablets aren't worth good money, and when you buy one, they prove it.

I'm beginning to think that Léo Apothekar might have been onto something getting HP out of the tablet business. It has nothing to do with the quality of WebOS, it has to do with the quality of the manufacturing business model.

p.s. An earlier version of this post named RIM as a chicken. Alas, it seems the only question left is whether they're a roaster or a fryer. Either way, [they're done](http://www.bgr.com/2011/09/29/rim-reportedly-bails-on-playbook-considers-exiting-tablet-market/).
