## Did you ever take that test yourself?

These days it's popular to include samples of your code with your résumé, often in the form of links to Github or other popular open source repositories. The premise is that it shows you can actually write code, which is much more important than showing that you can say the obviously right things about code. For those who haven't bound their hands in barbed wire with "Do not publish open source even if on your own time and equipment" employment agreements, it's a good thing to be able to point to something you're proud of.

The flip side of that, of course, is that companies can do exactly the same thing. Some companies directly sponsor open source projects or allow their employees to publish code where a prospective employee can have a look. For example, [DocumentCloud](https://github.com/documentcloud) publishes its popular infrastructure tools (like [Backbone](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone) and [Underscore](https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore)) on Github, and team members like [Jeremy Ashkenas](https://github.com/jashkenas) publish projects like [Docco](https://github.com/jashkenas/docco) and [CoffeeScript](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script).

If you're looking for a job, it's a lot easier to guess what you're getting into with a company that shares code than with a company that keeps everything under lock and key, just as it's easier as an employer to quickly evaluate a prospect by looking at the kind of code they publish. So here are the obvious questions for job hunters: Do you have links to your published source code on your home page, blog, and résumé? If not, why not?

_And what's good for the Goose is good for the Gander_: Employers, if you are looking for the kind of people who publish quality code you can review, do you yourself support and publish open source? Can job-hunters find links to your repositories and the repositories of your top programmers in your job ads, jobs page, and company home page?

If not, why not?
