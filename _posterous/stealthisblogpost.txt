## Steal This Blog Post!

_The following words appear in the preamble to a collection of my blog posts about freedom entitled [Steal This Book!](http://leanpub.com/stealthisbook) Both the book and this post are 100% free-as-in-speech and 100% free-as-in-beer._

**Introduction**

I was born in Canada in 1962. Coincidentally, 1962 is also the year that James Meredith became the first Negro (that was the offensive term of the day) to attend Ole Miss. It was not easy: Despite having served his country honourably in the Air Force, his application was rejected twice. Assisted by Medgar Evers and the NAACP, he fought all the way to the US Supreme Court, which ruled that he was to be admitted.

Riots broke out, and the attorney general sent in 500 US Marshals and a combat battalion. The president sent in military police, the National Guard, and the US Border Patrol. Two people were killed and two hundred troops were injured or wounded in the effort to uphold America's constitution and laws.

Meredith graduated on August 18, 1963 with a degree in political science and went on to a life of service to his country's ideals. After all, he fought for the same thing America's founders fought for, the same thing American servicemen fought for: Freedom. What could be more American than to fight for freedom against oppression?

As a Canadian, I share the deep and basic lust for freedom that America espouses. Canada, as everyone knows, was the beacon of hope for the oppressed during the time of Slavery. Canada was the haven for those who refused to serve during the Vietnam War. Like America, Canada was a safe country for those who fled the Nazis during the Second World War.

And thus, I hold the ideals of freedom dear. I am patriotic about freedom. From time to time I quibble with my friends about exactly *how* to achieve those ideals. For example, some people believe that healthy citizens are more free than those who cannot afford health care. Some people believe that the freedom of the marketplace is more important. But we always agree on the overall goal.

Today we still fight for freedom. Although racism will never go away, today there are people continuing the fight for reproductive rights and for the right to marry the person you love. And there are people fighting for the right to say what you please, to whom you please, about what you please, without fear.

That much has not changed a bit in the fifty years since I was born, and the issues of our time like Freedom Zero and Cyber-Privacy and the right to Internet access are no different than the freedom to attend university or the freedom to protest against injustice.

What could be more American or Canadian than to fight for the freedom to speak freely, the freedom to associate, academic freedom, scientific freedom, freedom from intrusion of privacy, freedom from unjust imprisonment, the freedom to tinker, or the freedom to publish the truth?

**Steal This Book!**

The title of [this book](http://leanpub.com/stealthisbook) is, of course, a blatant rip-off of Abbie Hoffman's 1970 revolutionary how-to, "[Steal This Book](http://www.semantikon.com/StealThisBookbyAbbieHoffman.pdf)." I don't recall if I stole a copy in the 1970s, but I do recall reading it with interest. Some years later, I dropped into a bookstore and asked if they had a copy. The clerk had heard of it. "Oh yes, I think we have one left. It's in the American History section."

American History? Yes, it seems that instructions for "Growing cannabis, starting a pirate radio station, living in a commune, stealing food, shoplifting, stealing credit cards, preparing a legal defence, making pipe bombs, and obtaining a free buffalo from the Department of the Interior" are now largely obsolete, and the value of the book is now entirely in its portrayal of the "Yippie Zeitgeist."

Nevertheless, Abbie Hoffman's "Pig Empire" is still as corrupt and authoritarian as it ever was. Its Military Industrial Complex is still enriching the 1% with profiteering on the trillions being spent waging unwinnable wars in foreign lands. [Our governments wiretap every telephone call and all internet traffic, saving it all forever, and appears to be capable of breaking all known forms of encryption](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter/).

As George Carlin [observed](http://motleynews.net/2012/02/04/the-truth-about-republicans-by-george-carlin/), "They're against street crime, providing that street isn't Wall Street." You will go to jail for stealing, provided you aren't stealing elections with robocalls or voting machines. The police state of today spends three times as much money imprisoning people as it does educating them.

While 1970's "Pig Empire" tolerated Abbie Hoffman writing a book with instructions for stealing property, 2012's police state will jail you for publishing decryption keys or linking to copyrighted content. We've lost the freedom to speak and publish in my lifetime, not gained it. Publishing has its place in the quest to change the world for the better. If action is a flame that consumes the old to make room for the new, words are embers that carry the fire to where it can blaze. That's why these essays are "Free as in Speech" _and_ "Free as in Beer."

So, while you can tweet a link to download the book, you can also email the PDF, put it on torrents, host it in a bitlocker, or do whatever you like with it, subject to the MIT License terms. And I want you to do that! If you like what you read, pass it on any way you can.

Please, exercise your freedoms while you still have them, and [steal this book!](http://leanpub.com/stealthisbook)
