## The "Tragic and Ironic" death of Mr. Heselden

People seem ghoulishly amused by [the death of Jimi Heselden](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-11416654), who owns a company that distributes Segway scooters. He died in a misadventure while riding an off-road model on his estate. The accident way particularly dramatic, involving a fall off a sea-cliff. Combine the dramatic death and the unfortunate coïncidence of the man's occupation, and you have people calling the death a tragedy, ironic, or both.

I am not a grammarian, however I suggest his death is neither tragic nor ironic:

**Tragedy** is a "form of drama that depicts the suffering of a heroic individual who is often overcome by the very obstacles he is struggling to remove. The protagonist may be brought low by a character flaw or, as Hegel stated, caught in a 'collision of equally justified ethical aims.'" Of course, many people apply the word "tragedy" to any emotionally heart-wrenching death or deaths, such as the death of Terry Fox, who succumbed to cancer while running across Canada to raise money for cancer. Mr. Heselden's death is certainly unfortunate, but the word loses all meaning if we are to apply it to every fatal accident.

"Irony" is a word has been [brutally misused](http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2003/jun/28/weekend7.weekend2) for over a decade. Nevertheless, let's have a go at explaining why a scooter fall is not ironic. **Situational irony** (also known as cosmic irony) occurs when it seems that "God or fate is manipulating events so as to inspire false hopes, which are inevitably dashed". What hopes were dashed? Surely the scooter is not sold as a safety device?

A tragic and ironic death for the Segway company owner would be something like the following:

Act I:

Imagine that Mr. Heselden had difficulty walking due to an accident suffered while promoting the military blast materials sold by his former business. He suffers and takes some time off on his estate, where he realizes that sacrificing his life to business is a mistake. He sells his company and is at peace, but one flaw remains: Because of the inhjuries suffered making the money to buy his land, he can not take the hikes he needs enjoy the property. This is _ironic_.

Act II:

Inspired by the possibility of being mobile again, he buys a Segway. This works so well he buys the company and dedicates his life to making the outdoors accessible to everyone. Caught up in the passion, he throws himself into his new Segway distribution business. Alas, the overwork and lack of exercise lead to a massive and fatal coronary. Death by overwork when you are trying to retire is tragic, and to do so when promoting a recreational device is _tragically ironic_.
