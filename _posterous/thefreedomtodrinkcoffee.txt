## The freedom to drink coffee

I read this analogy comparing free software programmers to labour organizers:

> It's like an autoworker who wants everybody to unionize, and so he organizes sit-ins, but instead of ever forming the union that one guy just sits around all the time not working, ticking everybody else off.

Well now, as a [little-s socialist](http://raganwald.posterous.com/hello-my-name-is-reginald-and-i-am-a-socialis), I think I ought to respond with vigour. This is not what writing free software is about, not in the least. A sit-in is where you obstruct the company's operations. A strike is where you withhold your labour from the company. In both cases you are trying to change the company's behaviour.

**Socialism and Freedom**

Writing free software is not at all like organizing a sit-in or going on strike. _Writing free software is like going into competition with the company_. Imagine you don't like working for a big coffee chain. So you start giving away coffee from a cart on the street in front of your house. How is this like organizing a sit-in? And who are you ticking off? The people who want to drive through and get their coffee without parking their SUV and approaching your cart on foot?

The salient broken assumption is that free software programmers aren't working. We are working, even when we're just [dabbling](http://raganwald.posterous.com/from-dabbling-to-shipping-successful-software). It's just that we aren't working on what some people want us to work on. Maybe we will change the world and one day all software will be free, then again maybe not. But it could be that we are satisfied merely to live our lives in accordance with our principles, and we ask only that the fruit of our labour, our software, be used and distributed in accordance with those principles as well.

i don't know why or how this could tick anybody off. Recently, some software was removed from the iOS and MacOS stores because some or all of it is licensed in a manner that is incompatible with the license governing Apple's distribution of software. People are ticked off about this. I'm bewildered. Somebody wrote something, for free. He said, "Here is the fruit of my labour, use it, but I ask A and B and C of you. If A, and B and C are not compatible with your principles, please don't use or distribute my software."

A and B and C are not compatible with the way Apple does business, so this software will not be distributed by Apple. And? There are no bad guys here. Apple chooses the way it does business very carefully. The original author chose the way he licensed the fruit of his labour very carefully. And people who purchase iPhones or Macs made their choice very carefully. I own an iPhone. I realize I cannot use it in a free manner. I wrote software for iPad, and I deliberately made it a web-based game specifically so that it could be distributed in a manner compatible with my principles.

So far, what I see are free people making free choices, and there are no losers. I do not lose because I cannot run a free program on my iPhone. If I wanted to do that, I wouldn't have purchased an iPhone. I haven't lost anything. Nobody gave me something and then took it away from me. My iPhone runs the same software today that it did last month.

We Apple customers haven't lost anything, we can still use all of the software we were promised. Apple hasn't lost anything. If it wanted to distribute free software, it could change its policies. And the original software author hasn't lost anything, his software is still being distributed in accordance with his principles and wishes.

**Coffee and Code**

This brings me back to the quoted simile. I reject the comparison of free software programmers to autoworkers trying to unionize the company. A better comparison would be that someone writing free software is like a hippie who grows his own coffee beans and sells them at the side of the road by his farm. You can't buy them at Tim Horton's or Dunkin Doughnuts because the hippie doesn't like what the big chains do with the coffee.

So you go to the hippie or you don't drink the coffee he grows. The problem is that you bought yourself a shiny espresso machine that only takes pods distributed by the manufacturer. So even if you buy the hippie's beans, you can't make yourself any coffee with them because the machine won't take them unless they've been shipped to the manufacturer and packaged into little special pellets.

How is this the hippie's fault for not liking big coffee chains or espresso machines? You can drink plenty of coffee, and you can buy a plot of land and grow your own coffee to be distributed by the espresso machine maker. You can buy a different kind of espresso maker that takes ground beans directly.

The hippie is free and you are free. The hippie hasn't shut down the big chains, but that isn't his goal. His goal is to sleep at night, comfortable that he has made choices compatible with his personal beliefs and that he has given other people the freedom to make choice compatible with their personal beliefs.

I can think of no greater definition of freedom.
