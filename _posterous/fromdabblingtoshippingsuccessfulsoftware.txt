## From Dabbling to Shipping Successful Software

Sebastian Marshall wondered whether there's a simple way to separate _Generalists_ (whom he seems to hold in high regard) from _Dabblers_ (whom he seems to, well, not esteem quite so highly). After recalling Steve Jobs' famous quote that "Real artists ship," Sebastian wonders:

> Could it be that the difference between a generalist and a dabbler is just saying "this is as done as it's going to be" and shipping the work?---[What Separates a Generalist and a Dabbler?](http://www.sebastianmarshall.com/?p=438)

I'm going to say that we need to be specific about what we mean by the word "ship." If we just mean, "releases software," then I'm proof that you can dabble and release a few things as you go. In 2011, I released [Wood and Stones](https://github.com/raganwald/wood_and_stones#readme), [iGesture](https://github.com/raganwald/iGesture#readme), [jQuery Combinators](https://github.com/raganwald/JQuery-Combinators), [jQuery Predicates](https://github.com/raganwald/jQuery-Predicates), [Cartography](https://github.com/raganwald/cartography.js), and I just knocked off the first round of documenting [Faux](https://github.com/unspace/faux#readme), the official "It's terribly embarrassing but it works" release of an [Unspace Interactive](http://unspace.ca) Javascript framework that started its life as "Roweis."

One can argue that I didn't ship these things, I just _released_ them. To use an analogy, I didn't sell these things, instead I dumped them on the curb for people to drive by and help themselves. Shipping is the act of distributing a real software product. A real software product directly addresses the question of why someone would change their behaviour to adopt the program, and creating a real software product involves spending most of your time figuring out how to get someone to use it, not spending most of your time figuring out how to make it work.

To me, the expression "_Real artists ship_" means more than just dumping some byproducts of your dabbling on [Github](http://minimal-github.gilesb.com/raganwald). It means making hard choices that address the social behaviour of other people, it means sacrificing some of your idalism to find a middle ground between your dreams and the real world. It means locking your narcissism in a drawer long enough to figure out what makes people tick.

As an example of sacrificing idealism, I spent all of yesterday taking a first crack at [Faux's](https://github.com/unspace/faux#readme) readme page when I could have been polishing some internals that I find embarrassing. That kind of decision is an example of the difference between shipping and releasing: Shipping involves painful trade-offs between what you'd like to do and what you must do.

If I could only provide one binary choice, it would be this: A dabbler is inwardly focused and releases software, a generalist is outwardly focused and ships products.

**my yardstick**

But I don't think the world is quite so black and white as to provide a simple binary choice between greatness and failure, between being a ho-hum dabbler or a generalist standing proudly on a pedestal. But having a yardstick is useful for measuring your own results and making decisions about what to change in the future. Therefore, I offer the following five-step scale:

At the bottom, **pure dabbling**: Investigation and learning without any releases. You have satisfied your own needs for growth and change.

Next up, **productive dabbling**: Investigation and learning, with some software emitted as a kind of accidental by-product. There was no question being answered, no focus, just banging something out for shits and giggles. Well, perhaps not _just _shits and giggles, perhaps because writing something helps you clarify your own understanding. Most of the little pieces of code that show up in my Homoiconic blog like [let](https://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2010/10/let.md) or [Recursive Combinators](https://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2008-11-26/practical_recursive_combinators.md) fit this description.

A step above productive dabbling is **producing [concept software](https://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2010/09/concept.md#readme)**. The software is written with some uncertainty beforehand: You are trying to discover whether something is feasible. The resulting code answers a question, although it doesn't address social issues of adoption. Sometimes you write something for your own use: This is a kind of concept software, in that since you only write it for yourself, you forgo all thought of what it would take for other people to want to use it. [i](https://github.com/raganwald/iGesture#readme)[Gestur](https://github.com/raganwald/iGesture#readme)[e](https://github.com/raganwald/iGesture#readme), [jQuery Combinators](https://github.com/raganwald/JQuery-Combinators), and [jQuery Predicates](https://github.com/raganwald/jQuery-Predicates) all resulted from attempts to scratch my own itches when I was writing [Wood and Stones](https://github.com/raganwald/wood_and_stones#readme).

A step above producing concept software is **shipping software**. The software is written with the deliberate intention of being adopted by other people and this goal is important enough that you are prepared to make trade-offs along the way. This implies a deadline of sorts, even if self-imposed. [Faux](https://github.com/unspace/faux#readme) is an example of this. Although it was written for a specific, professional project, it has been written with adoption in mind from the start. With this step, you have decided that other people are at least as important as yourself.

At the top is **shipping successful software**. You intended, you succeeded. You made the right trade-offs. You have demonstrated a keen understanding of other people and what is required to create growth and change for them.

As we go into the New Year, you may find this scale useful for measuring your own results and for deciding where to put more of your energy in the coming twelve months. I hope that 2011 is your best year ever!
