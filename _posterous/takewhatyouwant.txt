## Take what you want

Thomas runs into George at the coffee shop.

"Wow!" George says, "Wait 'til you hear what happened to me this morning. I was sitting here managing my adword spend when I noticed a babe giving me the eye. Webmistress type, you know, Macbook Air, wearing a deerstalker cap, and stretched over a impressive set of melons, she wore an 'I had friends on that Death Star' tee shirt."

Thomas nods.

"She gets up, grabs the bathroom key, and heads into the disabled/family bathroom. The one where you can get a lot of privacy. I use it to check on my Ashley Madison afilliate income. Anyhow, she stops at the door and gives me an unmistakable look. So I slip my laptop into my bag and follow her in."

Thomas licks his lips.

"The door closes. She pulls her shirt up over her head and I can see her breasts are bursting out of a lacy bra. She looks me straight in the eye and says the magic words: 'Take what you want.' So I did."

Thomas whistles in appreciation, admiring George's new Macbook Air. "Good call," he agrees, "The tee shirt was probably too small."
