## Raganwald: Mistaking superficialities for deep understanding since 1962

Dear Raganwald:

You have underwhelmed me with your insight, [again](http://raganwald.posterous.com/i-cannot-rightly-apprehend-the-confusion-of-i).

In [this](http://raganwald.posterous.com/another-meta-joke) unfunny attempt at a joke, you tell a story in which the protagonist---naturally a blowhard would star in his own stories---goes into a tavern full of men telling stories by number and he says the number corresponding to a story about a protagonist who goes into a tavern full of men telling stories by number.

It's superficially recursive, and had you simply said that, it would be yet another trite variation of a story that has yet to be improved upon. However, you were not content with banality and tried to drag Lisp into the story by claiming that telling this story is somehow symptomatic of Lisp programmers. Clearly, you suffer from either or both of two mental maladies: You are an idiot, or you take your readers for idiots.

Here's the thing: "Recursion" is only considered a totemic property of Lisp programming by people whose understanding of Lisp has been gleaned from snatches of Gödel-Escher-Bach skimmed in their undergraduate days. It's true that some Lisp programmers consider recursion to be elegant, as do many non-Lisp programmers. And its true that in 1959, recursion as the centerpiece of programming was considered a hot new idea.

But it has been more than fifty years since Lisp was introduced, and fixating upon recursion is the hallmark of a dilettante. Recursion of a property of mathematics and of nearly every modern programming language. What makes Lisp stand apart from other languages is [metaprogramming](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Metaprogramming). I expect you will rush to Google, so I will save you a trip: _Macros_. The hallmark of a true Lisp programmer is not his approach to recursion, it's his approach to writing programs from the bottom up starting with the very syntax of the language.

You may feel very smug about the fact that from time to time one of your posts appears on the front page of Hacker News, but I remind you that even a stopped clock is right twice a day. If you wish to improve, let go of the idea that you know it all, and rededicate your self to learning. You may in fact be the smartest guy you have ever seen, but only because you spend so much time gazing fondly at yourself in the mirror.

Here's something you can start with. One of the most insightful things ever said about Lisp is that **Lisp is a **_programmable_** programming language**_._ Figure out what that really means, and its implications. Learn why programming a programming language is not the same thing as building another leaky abstraction. Keep at it until you achieve enlightenment.

Although I have shown you the way, I fully expect you are going to tell me about DSLs and [rewrite_rails](https://github.com/raganwald/rewrite_rails) and that [Ruby is an acceptable value of Lisp](http://www.randomhacks.net/articles/2005/12/03/why-ruby-is-an-acceptable-lisp). To that, I reply [Blub](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html)!

I will end my letter with a joke that even you ought to grasp:

> A Lisp programmer walks into a bar. "Scotch," he says to the bartender. "Say, you wanna hear a joke about Ruby programmers?"
> 
> The bartender scowls menacingly: "I wrote the bar's Point of Sale system in Ruby. You sure you want to tell me that joke?"
> 
> The programmer throws back the Scotch and puts some money down. "Naaah," he says, getting up to leave. "I hate it when I have to explain the punchline."
