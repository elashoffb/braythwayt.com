So, it seems that a couple of Brits travelling to the US on holiday were detained for twelve hours and then deported for having tweeted nasty phrases like "Destroy America" and "Dig up Marilyn Monroe's grave" when discussing their holiday plans.

Now as just about everybody in the English-speaking world knows, to "destroy" something sometimes means blowing it up violently. But it also sometimes means making a joke that has people falling down in laughter (Man, I destroyed Reddit with my joke about [the three engineers who get in a car](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ntd43/software_bug_fingered_as_cause_of_aussie_a330/c3bvhyy?context=3)). And it sometimes means to defeat in a peaceful competition (The Canadian women are planning on destroying the USA in the gold medal ice hockey match).

The TSA people know this! So what's the deal?

Consider this: The same tools that can find your tweets are part of a big machine that follow you around, see if you talk to other suspects, watch whether you are buying fertilizer and diesel fuel, and so on. If for one moment the authorities suspected these two of travelling to the US for the purpose of violence, they would not have been given a stern talking-to and deported, they'd have been water-boarded.

I'm left with no option but to quote the late George Carlin, whose gravestone ought to be inscribed: "I told you so." Why does the TSA constantly disrupt people's privacy and security?

> To remind you that they can fuck with you whenever they want.---George Carlin

The more the state visibly and publicly fucks with ordinary people, the more desensitized we become to it, the more we accept it as "business as usual." Today it's a tweet. Tell me, will you be surprised if one day we have microphones in public places and someone is barred from entering the USA because of something they said in public? What about if I call a snitch line and report that you said "Destroy America" in private? Would you expect the TSA to treat that differently?

What kind of a world are we living in where you can't say anything for fear of the police fucking with you?
