## The Tryanny of False Positives

> "Here's the deal: Airport DHS scrutiny is a gating function. It lets the spooks narrow down their search criteria. Once you get pulled aside for secondary at the border, you become a 'person of interest' --- and they never, ever let up. They'll scan webcams for your face and gait. Read your mail. Monitor your searches."

All your data is fed into a big hopper that checks for 'suspicious patterns,' using deviation from statistical norms to nail you."

Nice story, with chilling overtones for contemporary life. Sure, a few details are wrong now. Google left China, but not because China was hacking Google's users, but because China was hacking Google itself. And now Google obsesses over Apple and Facebook instead of Yahoo. But the details are right, and I think this is where we very nearly are today, if we aren't there already.

And I'll tell you why I'm against it. Not because of some airy-fairy human right to privacy or freedom to assemble or what-have-you. But this:

If you go by "suspicious patterns," everyone is going to end up being a suspect. Everyone, that is, except the people who carefully manufacture their online personae. Which will probably end up being cyber-paranoids and actual criminals who are in the business of looking innocuous. Everybody else will become a "person of interest."

I have 500+ Facebook friends. Statistically, how many degrees of separation am I from someone who gives money to a charity that is suspected of being a front for militant activities? My parents protested in the 60s. Do they have criminal records? Ancient dossiers for being radicals? How many of my University professors were [FLQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_de_lib%C3%A9ration_du_Qu%C3%A9bec) sympathizers? Or just thought that arresting 497 of people and interrogating them without trial or legal counsel was a bad idea? I wrote some encryption software for the Apple Newton. Oops, that was considered a munition in the 90s. I enjoy the espresso at [Jet Fuel](http://jetfuelcoffee.com/). How many time shave I searched Google Maps for its address?

I could go on, but my point isn't that I'm unusual, but rather that I'm bland. I think if you dig deep enough, everybody has something unusual in their profile. In the past, nopbody could be bothered to dig deep enough without soem provocation or cause. Now the computer does it for us, so we have red flags for everyone.

And?

Well, it's like this. What I believe is going to happen is that since everyone is a suspect, police officers will have to rely on hunches and intuition: _That guy is acting suspicious. He looks like a terrorist. Let's look him up. Bam! He retweeted a bunch of stuff about OccupyWhatever and he belongs to the same facebook cycling group as a known mercenary soldier. Hah! I knew my hunch was correct. Let's bring him in for questioning._

Instead of using data to find the "bad guys," we'll use data to validate the practice of picking bud guys out of our police asses. And I know how that story ends up: We arrest guys with turbans, completely ignorant of the fact that Sikhs and Muslims are unrelated. Or we fall back on the old standard of arresting young men for "Driving While Black." Or we pull someone in who happens to be dating the daughter of the Lieutenant after she was told to stick to her studies and stop partying. Or we infiltrate reading groups

In statistical terms, data only becomes information when it correlates with outcomes. When it doesn't, it shifts from being a tool for safeguarding our freedoms to becoming a tool for imposing tyranny.

(**Disclosure**: I'm not a spook, an intelligence hobbyist, or particularly knowledgeable about what governments are or aren't doing to collect information with or without judicial oversight. I profess to have some experience with software, but other than being born in the early nineteen-sixties, what do I know about oppression? This rant should be consumed with no less than a five kilogram bag of rock salt.)
