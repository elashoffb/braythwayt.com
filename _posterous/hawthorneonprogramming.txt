## Hawthorne on Programming

Two similar quotes:

  * [Learning Haskell made me a better C++ programmer](http://vallettaventures.com/post/17090296373/haskells-effect-on-my-c-exploit-the-type-system).
  * [Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html).

  
I think they are both true. Why? Check all that apply:

  * There's something special about Haskell.
  * There's something special about Lisp.
  * There's something special about learning a language with a paradigm that is orthogonal to your existing way of thinking about programs.
  * There's something special about the kind of person willing to learn a new language with an unfamiliar paradigm.
  * Writing programs in a new language forces you to think more carefully, [by dint of observing yourself write programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect).

For what it's worth, I have no idea which of these explanations is true, or for that matter, whether any of them are true. But regardless of the mechanism, I'm certain of the effect. So go out and learn something really new. If you need a suggestion from me, go [find some joy in combinators](https://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2008-11-16/joy.md): Make it a concatenative language like [Factor](http://factorcode.org/).
