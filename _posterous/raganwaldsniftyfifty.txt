## Raganwald's Nifty Fifty

Today is my fiftieth birthday:

I started posting essays on the internet in 2004, and I became a blogger a year or so later when I put an RSS feed together. In the past eight years the very best experiences I've received from the Internet have been the people I've met in person or online. The [Lightweight Languages mailing list](http://people.csail.mit.edu/gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/threads.html), the Joel on Software forums, Reddit, and the Hacker News communities have made me feel welcome and valued as a human being.

I can't think of a better present to receive from anyone, anywhere, and at any time than that simple feeling of being wanted. So now that it's my birthday, I will emulate the Hobbit custom and give you all the best present I've ever received: Know that I value and cherish you and the way you make me feel.

Thank you.
