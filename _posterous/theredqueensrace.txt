## The Red Queen's Race

It used to be that browsers were slow, so we rendered everything on the server dynamically. 

Then browsers became fast, so we started making rich applications and pushed rendering down to the client. We use things like Backbone and Haml-js to let the client render the templates. This scales effortlessly, because it follow's Pournelle's Law of "One user, at least one CPU." 

Now Amazon has given us the Kindle Fire, which takes browser-side computation and [pushes it back up to the server](http://9to5google.com/2011/09/29/the-secret-to-amazon-silk-browsers-speediness-webkit-and-spdy/). So I ask you: Do we render templates on the server? Or push the template down to the browser so that the Kindle Fire can intercept it and have the server render it after all?
