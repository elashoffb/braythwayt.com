## Coffee, anyone?

I've just promoted Moxie Marlinspike's anti-materialistic rant, "[The Worst](http://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/the-worst/)."

And yet, as we speak, I am sitting in a room decorated in a Piet Mondrian motif, and if I wish to have seven of my friends join me for dinner, I'll serve it on [Swid Powell](http://www.nanswid.com/swid-powell) china:

I guess I like the ascetic ideal, but I like designed objects as well. Coffee, anyone?
