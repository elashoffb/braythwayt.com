## Imagine if your house had Windows

So you buy a new home from a tract builder. It's almost exactly like everyone else's home, but you can customize a few details like your roof's colour scheme and you can install upgrades like a central vac. Fine.

A few years later, the builder is back. Studies show that people like stainless steel kitchens with six burner faux-professional stoves. You argue, but he elbows you aside and removates your kitchen. It looks great, almost as nice as the houses in the Apple Orchard subdivision, but after the reno you can't find anything, it's a pain to get used to the new setup.

Just when you've got the new kitchen figured out, the builder is back. Writing himself a generous cheque on your account, he explains that nobody uses CAT-5 for networking, you need wireless. You explain that you have abandoned the wiring that was pulled throughout the house and have your own wireless router which works just fine, but he's busy pulling the wires and putting his own router in the attic. There's plaster dust everywhere, but he explains that it's no big deal since he's also putting a new media centre in every room, there will be flat screens on every wall. Well, now you don't know what to do with the television that already works, and the new remote is ridiculously large, but things are a bit nicer, and you get used to it.

A year later he's back, and now he's explaining that people want to spend more time outside, so it's time to replace your back deck with a wonderful stone patio. There will be heat under the patio so you don't have to shovel it, but that requires replacing your FAG furnace with a boiler that can pump warm brine. As a bonus, you'll have a heated basement floor. It will take a few weeks to redo everything, and you need to move out while they demolish the floors. Once again you sigh and trudge through the disruption, paying his bill in full.

But one year later when he comes back, you stop him at the door. "I'm done," you explain, "I'm comfortable with my house just the way it is." His proposals _are_ nicer, but not nicer enough that you feel like putting up with the aggravation of changing your life around. You now understand why your parents carried on listening to eight tracks, they were _good enough_, and they couldn't be bothered to turn their life upside down just to have CDs or iTunes or anything else.

Really, you explain to the builder, it's a compliment. His work so far is so good that you're done. Finished. Happy as Larry. You're not the one complaining about your house being out-of-date.

"But..." stammers the builder, "What about the employees I have to feed? If you don't buy my upgrades, they'll starve. And I'm locked in competition with the Apple Orchard. They brilliantly switched from stationary edifices to mobile [bicycles](http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Bicycle.txt). They're eating my lunch! If I don't keep upgrading the houses I build, people will stop buying from me!"

You think for a moment, then respond with a question:

"How is any of this **my** problem?"

And you close your door. And lock your Windows.
