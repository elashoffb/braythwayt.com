## Reg Braithwaite is a Leanpubber!

Today is my first day as a Leanpubber, and I'm excited! That's right, I have a new job, and it's one that gets my juices flowing.

[Leanpub](http://leanpub.com) is a technology company committed to making book authors successful by eliminating the friction between the author's idea and satisfied readers. Earlier this year, I used Leanpub to publish a book, and I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to test out a few ideas. I was able to succeed with two books, "fail fast" with another, and be modestly satisfied with [a few more](http://leanpub.com/u/raganwald). Their workflow was perfect for staying focused on what sells and what doesn't.

I quickly found myself making suggestions and then getting emotionally involved in the future of publishing. I've always been really excited about the Internet's potential to give everyone a voice and provide a platform for everyone to start a business, even if it's a micro-business. Leanpub helps people do both of those things, so what could be more natural than getting in touch and asking, "How can I help chop wood and carry water?"

And there's plenty to do. I'm looking forward to helping make it easier to create books, helping make it easier to be successful with books, and just plain having fun trying to change the world. Peter and Scott, thanks for inviting me to the Leanpub party.
