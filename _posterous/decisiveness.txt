## Decisiveness

It was four in the morning. Wilmington was tossing and turning, unable to sleep. After an hour of this, his husband Fred turned on the light. "Darling," Fred asked, "Why are you so restless? Can't sleep? Is something on your mind?" 

Wilmington hesitated, then poured out his soul. He had come to realize that his current job just wasn't right, and he needed to move on to fresh challenges. But at the same time, he was an essential technical lead on a big project, and he was in the process of landing another project for the firm, so he couldn't simply quit... He felt awful, he didn't know what to do. So he worried. 

Fred listened sympathetically, hugged Wilmington, and then picked up his iPhone. "Call Wilmington's Boss" he said aloud, and after a moment, he could hear Bjarne's groggy voice. "Yes," Bjarne asked, "What's going on?" 

Fred spoke crisply, "Wilmington will be leaving your employ. Good night!" He disconnected, turned the ringer off, and tossed the phone in a drawer.

Wilmington stared, aghast. "Fred!" he exclaimed, "What have you done?" 

Fred smiled and gave him another hug. "Now that you've quit, you know exactly what to do: Find the job that's right for you." 

"But..." stammered Wilmington, "The project, the deal..." 

"Oh," smiled Fred, "Those are Bjarne's problems now. Let him stay awake worrying!"

Wilmington thought about that, then smiled and turned out the light. He was soon fast asleep.
