## The Kernel is a rag not even fit to wrap a fish

The title is my twelve-word review of this angry and bilious rant chock-to-the-brim with baseless ad hominem abuse and pseudo-scientific babble: 

[http://www.kernelmag.com/yiannopoulos/4115/put-a-sock-in-it-you-dickless-wond...](http://www.kernelmag.com/yiannopoulos/4115/put-a-sock-in-it-you-dickless-wonders/)

But on second thought, I may be intellectually dishonest in accusing the paper of not being fit to wrap fish. Although I have not tried it as an experiment, it could well be found that even the most putrescent fish corpse would be improved by being wrapped tightly in this writing before being incinerated: 

The magazine's stench would, I'm sure, overpower and mask that of the fish.
