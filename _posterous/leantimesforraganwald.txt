## Lean Times for Raganwald

As you know, I have been and am a big fan of [Leanpub](http://leanpub.com). They do a great job of publishing my books. I embrace both their lean publishing philosophy and the potential of the "long tail" they afford. While I remain incredibly bullish about LeanPub's people and future, we have decided that I will zig while they will zag.

Chemistry is a tricky thing, and I will always look upon our short time together as a kind of "Lean Employment" in the same spirit that Leanpub the company encourages experimentation with tight feedback loops for publishing books.

Thanks, guys, and all my very best wishes for much-deserved success.
