> I think it's very important to understand that this idea of "no compromise" matters. And this idea that you can pick whichever one you want.---[RIM co-CEO Jim Balsillie](http://www.businessinsider.com/rim-ceo-playbook-android-2011-3)

Jim, you can't have it both ways. "_No compromise_" means that there is only one way to do it, the best way. "_You can pick whichever one you want_" means that there's more than one way to do it and various compromises must be made to support them all. No matter, although it's oxymoronic to pursue both strategies, your actions have made it very clear that the Playbook is trying to do everything and is absolutely going to be a compromise product.

I believe your approach comes from your undeniable success in "The Enterprise." When you are selling one hundred tablets to individuals, the dynamic is this: Tablet A does a good job of appealing to half of the market. Tablet B does a good job of appealing to the other half of the market. Then the Playbook comes along and takes a compromise position, doing a mediocre job of appealing to the entire market. A and B divide the market, and Playbook gets table scraps.

However, the enterprise is allegedly different. The argument is that if a committee is choosing a single tablet for 100 people to use, even if half would be better using A and the other half would be better using B, Playbook is "good enough" for everyone and so A is shut out, B is shut out, and RIM gets 100 Playbook sales.

I'd buy that argument if tablets will be purchased the way PCs and corporate phones used to be purchased. However, some things have changed. You can have web apps that play identically on Android and iOS tablets. You can have push notification to both devices. You can get Exchange email on both devices. Maybe A or B will do a good job of appealing to half of a company's employees and yet still be good enough for the other half? In that case, your advantage in doing a mediocre job for everyone could be illusory. 

I am not sure if companies need to standardize on tablets the way they needed to standardize on phones ten years ago or on PCs twenty years ago. It might be that enterprises happily buy A for everybody, B for everybody, or let people use A or B as they prefer. Times seem to have changed in the last decade. Your company believes otherwise, that much is obvious, and you are betting thousands of jobs on your belief.

As Georges St-Pierre says, "Good luck with that."

p.s. [silvestrov](http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=silvestrov) makes in interesting point on Hacker News. Maybe iPad is actually the safe choice in the enterprise market?

> I don't think the PlayBook, Xoom, etc are going to stay around for long enough time. All the iPod killers were launched and died quicker than a committee could make a decision on what to standardize on.

> The iPod killers were somewhat standardized as they used Microsoft's DRM. The iPad killers are way less standardized, the only dependable cross-platform standard for them are html5 (i.e. using WebKit).

> How many tablet vendors can you depend on still making tables 2-3 years from now that will be backward compatible with their current tablet?

> The enterprise sector dislikes Apple because of the uncertainty of future Mac products, but for tablets it seems like it is the other way around: you know that Apple will still make iPads 3 years from now, that they will be backward compatible, how big screen they will have, what the primary SDK will look like.
