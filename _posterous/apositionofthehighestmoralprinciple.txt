## A position of the highest moral principle

Like the President of the United States, my parents have two different skin tones and come from two different cultures. They were good, loving parents. Nevertheless, their marriage was illegal in many places when I was born. Why? Because some people considered it "immoral," and their hatred and bigotry was allowed to trump the constitution and principles of equality that form the backbone of our values. 

Half a century later, we have put men on the moon, used the Internet to bring people together, ended the cold war that threatened to destroy the world in Nuclear Holocaust, and eradicated diseases like Smallpox. We fly around the world inexpensively and quickly. We have made great progress on so many fronts. And yet. 

Fifty years from now, I will be dead, but somebody, somewhere, will be writing that they had loving, good parents whose marriage was illegal in many places. Why? Because today, some people consider it "immoral," and their hatred and bigotry is still allowed to trump the constitution and principles of equality that form the backbone of our values. 

The whole point of valuing something is that you are prepared to make sacrifices for it. For example, many people value freedom of speech, to the point where they consider it more important to allow bigots to spread a message of hate and fear than to curtail the right of the people to speak their mind. It works the same way with equality of marriage.

I accept that some people believe that equality of marriage is in opposition to their religious teachings or social values. But my challenge to them is to treat it the way others treat freedom of speech, to say: "I disagree with how that person over there takes advantage of equality of marriage, but I will defend to the death their right to do so."

That would be a position of the highest moral principle.
