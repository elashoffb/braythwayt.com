## Dear Jeff Bezos:

Jeff:

I'm an Amazon Associate. I've pimped my favourite books on my blog for years, and in exchange you send me a modest gift certificate every month. I spend the proceeds at [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) buying books like the fabulous [The Making of "The Empire Strikes Back."](http://amzn.to/cejz62) (It arrived yesterday. Wonderful. Wonderful!) You also let me pimp CDs, and I sometimes buy CDs from you with my gift certificates. If, that is, I can't buy them on iTunes. It's that instant gratification thing.

As Joel Spolsky said about the now-defunct Napster, "[It's interesting because you can type the name of a song and listen to it ](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html)_[right away](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html)_." In iTunes, I can type the name of a song and listen to it right away. Thanks to Apple's [massive, cast-iron balls](http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/) when negotiating with the record companies, I can also back that song up, move it around, and generally treat it like something I bought for my own convenience. I don't share my music with friends, I just like to _type the name of a song and listen to it right away_.

Which brings me to Amazon. You gladly allow me to pimp your MP3 music out to all my friends. I just [tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/raganwald/status/27947861721) about Chic's awesome groove, "I Want Your Love," and I was able to link to your MP3 download. If 100 of my followers buy it from you, I might earn enough to buy another song.

From Apple. On iTunes. Not from Amazon.

You know why? _Because you don't sell MP3s to Canadians_. And I know why that is. You sell books and CDs, so obviously you know all about currency exchange and hedging against fluctuations and everything else a billion dollar business does to buy something in one country and sell it in another. The difference between you and Apple is that Apple has worked out the rights to sell DRM-free music in Canada and you haven't. So they can sell me a song that I can play on my Mac or my iPhone or my iPod and you can't.

It seems to me that since Apple has the muscle to kick the music labels around a little, they do. It seems you don't want to or don't think you can. I think you can. Threaten them a little. Try negotiating with them one at a time. Stop selling their CDs and pretend you don't care if Walmart becomes America's largest music distribution business. Tell them to negotiate with Steve Jobs if they don't like your terms. Whatever.

The ridiculousness of you being able to sell me DRM-free physical music but not DRM-free digital music while your main competitor can sell me the DRM-free digital music that I want... I have no words, I feel like we're in an astonishing place in the universe where reality is warped, but there you have it. Music, TV, and Film Distribution exists in a Reality Distortion Field that dwarfs anything emanating from One Infinite Loop. And even more ridiculous is that I can sell an MP3 on your behalf _but I'm not allowed to buy what I'm selling_.

Please, fix this._ _**Make**_ _**the labels an offer they can't refuse**_. _Tell them that either their brains or their signature will be on the agreement and start selling MP3s in Canada.

Thank you.
