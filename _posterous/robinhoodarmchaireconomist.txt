## Robin Hood, Armchair Economist

Researchers at Oxford University recently unearthed new documents about the life of Robyn Hode of Locksley, Richard the Lion-heart's lover and the inspiration for the legend of "Robin Hood." He was, it seems well ahead of his time as an economist. 

Translated from the 12th century English, he is said to have opined that since the rich hoarded their assets and spent very little relative to their wealth, their existence threatened the prosperity of the nation. Whereas the poor spent all of their earnings, which circulated in the economy creating more wealth for everyone and greater security for the realm. 

Thus, he advocated a minimum tax upon the wealthy to act as an economic stimulus. Redistributing the wealth to the poor wasn't a moral imperative to Hode, but rather a pragmatic attempt to provide economic stimulus. Alas, his motives were misunderstood and the legends grew about his generosity and empathy, two things which apparently mattered little to a man who cared far more for his romantic partner Richard. 

Robyn Hode. Today he would say, "Forget trickle-down, open the flood gates."
