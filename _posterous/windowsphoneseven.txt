## Windows Phone Seven

**Promotional Blurb**

I see that Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 is "a complete reboot and from-the-ground-up rethinking of Microsoft's approach to mobile." It offers a groundbreaking new UI, ultra-responsive touch screen, and has a marketplace just like all the other attempts to play catch-up.

**And a Joke**

 

"Red Ron," the notorious labour activist is visiting Las Vegas on an organizing drive. He gets in a cab and the cabbie asks him where he wants to go. "Well," says Red Ron, "I'd like a little relaxation before I get started. Can you take me to a cathouse?"

 

"Sure," says the cabbie, "what kind of a place are you looking for?"

 

"Nothing special," Red Ron tells the cabbie. "You know, nice girls, clean place. And one more thing..."

 

"Yes?"

 

"My grandfather was a union man, my father was a union man, I'm a union man. This place must be organized, the girls must be unionized. No scabby shop for me."

 

The cabbie thinks for a moment. "I know just the place, it's called Workerby's! It unionized back in the seventies, and soon after that the union converted it to an employee-owned coöperative. It's as labour-friendly as you can get."

 

Red Ron likes the sound of that, and the cabbie takes him to Workerby's. Red Ron is ushered inside and to his delight the staff have heard of him and give him VIP treatment. He's soon relaxing in the lounge eyeing the lingerie-clad women draped over the furniture. They're all shapes, sizes, and ages. After his second drink, he makes his choice. "Let me have the dusky-skinned, dark-eyed beauty over there," he says, pointing at a twenty-something shapely lass.

 

He is ushered upstairs to a room, and he is soon undressed and waiting for her entrance. The door opens and an aged crone enters, clad in bathrobe and with her hair up in curlers.

 

Ron gets a little agitated. "Who the hell are you?" he demands, "You're in the wrong room. Where's the girl I picked?" The crone begins to undress. Ron leaps to his feet with hands on hips. "What, are you deaf as well as blind? I told you to get out and fetch me the girl I picked!!"

 

The crone smiles. "Sorry, dearie, but we make the rules, not the customers. I have seniority."
