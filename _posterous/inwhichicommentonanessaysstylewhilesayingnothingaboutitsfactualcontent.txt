## In which I comment on an essay's style while saying nothing about its factual content.

[Node.js is Cancer](http://teddziuba.com/2011/10/node-js-is-cancer.html)Â is a treat to be enjoyed when you haven't read anything by Zed-Fucking-Shaw in a while and need a fix. I say so with the confidence of someone who knows imitative blog style when he sees it: My own blogging style is a shameless copy of Joel on Software.

That being said, I believe that some articles, no matter how presented, are worth reading if you exit the process better informed than when you entered it. Other articles are entirely wrong, but are wrong in an interesting way that makes you think in order to refute them. I won't say which I think this is, but I will say that I wouldn't link to it if I thought that reading it was a waste of my time.

But back to the post's style. To borrow a phrase:

> Calling Node.js "cancer" is not edgy. Declining to sell your startup to Google with the majestic gesture of shitting on their conference table and then wiping your ass with their offer memorandum... That's edgy.
