## Translation from legalese and PR-speak to English of selected portions of another overfunded startup's communications as they "monetize" their service

Dear Users:

You are not our customers, you are the cattle we drive to market and auction off to the highest bidder. Enjoy your feed and keep producing the milk.

And keep telling us everywhere you go and what you see there. We'll do the rest.

If we ever feel like pretending to listen to you, we'll let you know. Your convenience and experience using the service that we built with our investor's money is not something we value above and beyond our ability to manipulate it to encourage you to do the things we and our sponsors want you to do.

So, shut up about not being able to easily view our content on services built by other investors---And it is **our** content, not your content. _Your_ content is stored on _your_ server that you pay for with _your_ money.

That is all.
