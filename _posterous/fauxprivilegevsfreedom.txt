## Faux-Privilege vs. Freedom

It's a commonplace thing to encounter super-rational people arguing for more personal responsibility and fewer government "handouts." Amazingly, they frame it as a kind of moral issue: We should all be free to do as we wish. Employers need not hire homosexuals, women, or people of colour. There shouldn't be a minimum wage. Taxation is stealing. And so on.

I also hear people saying that these arguments come from people of privilege. Living on the upper deck and being closest to the lifeboats, why should their passage fees be inflated to pay for lifeboats for the folks below in steerage?

It's time someone told the absolute, objective truth about this whole thing to everyone, and today that someone is me.

**Faux-Privilege**

First, **white american males working as computer programmers are not privileged members of society**. The entire middle class in American have what I call faux-pivilege. The _illusion_ of being privileged. Here's the acid test: Can you whip out your credit card and pay for any medical bills you may need a'la carte?

If you get cancer, will this bankrupt you? If so, you are not privileged. You are chained to your medical insurance, which in turn chains you to your employer. Who benefits from those chains? The truly privileged. There are two ends to every leash, and you are attached to the wrong end.

The great snow-job and fraud being perpetrated on the middle class is to believe that they are privileged and that the people below them are stealing their hard-earned wealth. Women! Blacks! Pansies! Fat-cat lazy teachers!! Welfare bums!!! As long as you're looking downward, you don't see the wealth being drained away by the people above you.

When someone is quoting Ayn Rand at you to explain why medicare or minimum wage or equality of opportunity is stealing from you and morally wrong, ask yourself: Who really benefits from your outrage?

Who benefits from you being chained to private medical insurance? Not you, you get the worst care in the world. Doctors get paid more in the US than in Canada, where they are regulated. So doctors win. Big Pharma wins. Your employer wins. What are you going to do, quit and start your own company? What if you get sick?

Who benefits from not hiring "minorities?" You think it's you having less competition for your job. But in reality, it's everyone being afraid that at any time, their employer can simply say "Smith, I just don't like you. or what you say on Twitter. Clean out your desk!" Employers benefit, not you, and every time they turn away a qualified brown person, they're sending a subtle message that they can just as easily turn away a qualified white person.

Ask yourself: If discriminating against minorities is all about a meritocracy, why do companies do such a shitty job of hiring qualified people, and then spend millions trying to force everyone to work at the lowest common denominator of productivity?

I'll tell you why: **People who believe that markets and companies select fairly for qualifications are fearless**. They know that they can always find and keep a job.

Ask yourself: If the rich pay so very little in taxes, what do they care if taxes go up on the middle class to pay for welfare or medicare or any other safety net program? Why aren't they happy for you to be happy?

I'll tell you why: **People with safety nets are fearless**. Some of those people lay about and rob the system. Maybe even 9 out of 10 do, I don't know. But what about the tenth? She writes a book or starts a company or speaks out against Wall Street robbing the country blind. She isn't worried about being unable to get a job if employers read her anti-corporate tweets. She isn't worried about being unable to pay for regular breast cancer screening.

Truly equal hiring and widespread safety nets make people fearless. And fearless people are free people. Free to sleep all day. But also free to vote as they please, speak out, investigate, prosecute, and make truly rational choices.

The truly privileged benefit from your fear. They benefit from taking away your freedoms. That's why they own Faux News that relentlessly tells Americans to fear the poor, to fear the godless, to fear the brown people, to fear the queer people, and to fear each other. That's why they're against the safety nets, even though they won't have to pay for them.

They want you afraid, so that you have the illusion of freedom but no real way to exercise your freedom.

Safety nets exist so people can live without fear. Safety nets make people free. And freedom, my friends, is something the truly privileged fear.
