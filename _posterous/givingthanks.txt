I'm thankful for the fact that very few people who follow [@raganwald](http://twitter.com/raganwald) understand the following joke, attributed to Dick Gregory:

> "I hear they're hiring Black Bus Drivers in Atlanta. Hard to find good ones: It's a tricky job driving a bus with a 25 foot steering column."

This was very funny in 1972. It's a historical footnote in 2012. That's a good thing, a very good thing.

Yes, I do look backwards and downwards and celebrate where I am. But at the same time, I am where I am because my parents fought to get me here. Women are where they are because their mothers, grandmothers, and aunts fought to get theme here. This is true everywhere we look: People with different religions. People from modest backgrounds who got rich in technology.

We are here today enjoying what we have because someone before us sacrificed to tear down a wall, to lower a barrier, to smooth out a rough road. And we honour them by tearing down a wall that remains. We honour their sacrifice by lowering a barrier that remains. We honour their gift by smoothing out another road, whether these be for ourselves or our children's generation.

Yes, I have many thanks to give. And the sincerest way to give thanks is to keep up the Good Fight.
