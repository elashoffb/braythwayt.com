## This jersey is not for sale

[Some companies are for sale](http://www.danshapiro.com/blog/2012/06/of-course-this-company-is-for-sale/). But some things, even companies, are not for sale.

I own a replica of Jackie Robinson's Kansas City Monarchs Negro League Jersey. I wear it to baseball games (where else?)

Twenty years ago, I was offered $100, cash, for my jersey at a Blue Jays game. I said "no." The offer was raised to $200, more than it would cost to replace it at the time. Again, I said no. I explained that it wasn't for sale. It had sentimental value to me. I had bought it at a certain point in my life, it was symbolic of a certain attitude I was cultivating at the time. I didn't need $200, and I didn't want another jersey, I wanted this one.

The fellow offering me the money explained that "Everything was for sale." I find such people manipulative. They have money, so they try to twist the rest of the world to play by their rules. It's as if we were playing Settlers of Catan, I had wood, he had stone, and he was demanding that I trade wood for stone. I needed to explain the value of wood to him.

I told him that it would take me four hours to earn $200, so it was worth four hours to me, right? He agreed. I then told him he could have the jersey if he worked for me for four hours. That was just about the end of conversation right there.

There's a well-known joke attributed to Winston Churchill where we establish that if I would take a million dollars for the jersey, I ought to take $200, and we're just haggling about the price. That's fundamentally broken reasoning. Deeply broken! Let's tell the story my way:

> "Young man, would you give me your jersey if I paid off your mortgage, credit cards, line of credit, utility bills, and gave you enough money to start a new company doing exactly what you want for two years?" Yes! "In that case, here's enough money to pay your cell phone bill. Give me the jersey." What do you take me for? "We've established your jersey is for sale, we're just haggling over the price."

Put it in terms of what the money means to you, these are not different spots on a smooth continuum. The one offer may change your life forever, the other makes no appreciable difference to you unless you need $100 to keep a telco from turning your phone off. The two aren't variations of the same proposition. I'm willing to trade my jersey, but only for a future where I am happier than the future where I keep it.

And the same goes for lots of other "negotiations." Many things in your life aren't for sale in any realistic sense, because if you actually sit down to contemplate how much money they would cost, you have to consider what it would take to buy you a future where youre' happier selling than you would be holding fast.

That isn't irrational, it just means you own something that isn't for sale.

p.s. I could use a little more cash right now, and indeed [I have a few things for sale on eBay](http://www.ebay.ca/sch/raganwald/m.html?_nkw=&_armrs=1&_from=&_ipg=25&_trksid=p3686). But the jersey isn't one of them :-)
