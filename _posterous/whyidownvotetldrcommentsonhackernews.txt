## Why I downvote "tl;dr" comments on Hacker News

From time to time, someone's response to a post will be "tl;dr." I understand this to be an acronym for _too long; didn't read_. I almost always downvote such comments. My rationalization is that mentioning that it is too long adds little to the discussion. It's much more useful if you can identify what needs to be trimmed, such as "Too long by half, Raganwald's essay would be far better without the gratuitous story about his days as a dishwasher." A heroic but rarely performed feat is for someone who thinks it is too long to summarize the post. So the excuse for downvoting "tl;dr" is that someone is cluttering up the commentary without contributing anything positive to other readers.

But you know what? That's not why I downvote "tl;dr." IThe real reason I downvote "tl;dr" is that I consistently write long essays and I lack the patience to edit them to manageable length. More importantly, I lack the moral fibre to discard perfectly good points. Any fool can chop filler out of an essay. It takes an author of sterling character to discard perfectly good ideas in the interest of making what remains an even better essay.

And I lack that character. Having written words about an idea I like, I find it very difficult to let go of them, and my writing suffers for it. So who do I punish for my lack of will? Yup, those who point out my flaws with an economy of expression I would do well to emulate.  


How ironic.
