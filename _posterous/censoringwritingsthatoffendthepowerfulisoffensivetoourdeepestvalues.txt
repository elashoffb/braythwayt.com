## Censoring writings that offend the powerful is offensive to our deepest values

> You seem to think that we might censor a student's thesis, which is lawful and already in the public domain, simply because a powerful interest ﬁnds it inconvenient. This shows a deep misconception of what universities are and how we work. Cambridge is the University of Erasmus, of Newton, and of Darwin; censoring writings that offend the powerful is offensive to our deepest values. Thus even though the decision to put the thesis online was Omar's, we have no choice but to back him. That would hold even if we did not agree with the material! Accordingly I have authorised the thesis to be issued as a Computer Laboratory Technical Report. This will make it easier for people to ﬁnd and to cite, and will ensure that its presence on our web site is permanent
