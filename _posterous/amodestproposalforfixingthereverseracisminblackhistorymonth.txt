## A modest proposal for fixing the reverse-racism in Black History Month

Mr. Concern Troll here. I agree, having a "Black History Month" is racist without some kind of "White History Month." I reject the charge that the other eleven months when people are deluged with Euro-centric history and culture constitute a celebration of White Culture. Plus, what kind of nonsense is it to Have MLK day in January, but Black History Month in February? That's like stealing an extra day for Black Pride.

So here's what we do: Let's be historically accurate and go with how long each cultural group has dominated North America. The facts, just the facts, **no matter how much some paranoid people whine and beg for privilege**. Now bear with me, because there is lots of debate and discussion about the exact dates. But going by my trusty Wikipedia:

> The archeological evidence suggests that the Paleo-Indians' first "widespread" habitation of America occurred during the end of the last glacial period or, more specifically, what is known as the late glacial maximum, around 16,500--13,000 years ago.

Ok. What happened next?

> Norse captain Leif Eriksson is believed to have reached the Island of Newfoundland circa 1000 AD. They named their new discovery Vinland. The only Norse site yet discovered in North America is at L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada. The Norse colonies were later abandoned.

And then?

> Settlement by the Spanish started the European colonization of the Americas.[21][22] They gained control of most of the largest islands in the Caribbeanand conquered the Aztecs, gaining control of present-day Mexico and Central America. This was the beginning of the Spanish Empire in the New World. The first successful Spanish settlement in continental North America was Veracruz in 1519, followed by many other settlements in colonial New Spain and Spanish Florida.  


  


> The first successful English settlements were at Jamestown (1607) (along with its satellite, Bermuda in 1609) and Plymouth (1620), in what are todayVirginia and Massachusetts respectively. The first French settlements were Port Royal (1604) and Quebec City (1608) in what is now Nova Scotia andQuebec. The Fur Trade soon became the primary business on the continent and as a result transformed the indigenous North American lifestyle.

We only care about North America, so let's go with the Europeans arriving around 1600. The slave trade was running full-tilt at this point. Slavery continued in the South until the end of the War of Northern Aggression in 1865, but things didn't get seriously equal for Negroes until the end of the second World War in 1945. The modern struggle for equality begun then and continues to this day.

Okay, that's our history. What do I suggest we do? First, we have the Paleo-Indians coming here 13,000 or more years ago. Let's call it **11,600 years ago** to make the arithmetic easy.

Next, we have the Whites who kept the boot on the neck of the Blacks from 1600 to 1945, let's call it 340 years to make the arithmetic easy. Then we have the Blacks with some equality for 60 years or so. It's all approximate, but hey.

So what I suggest is this: We have 12 months, we have 12,000 years of history

The first eleven months of the year are **First Nations History Months**.

In December, we need a week for Santa Claus, with a long week-end at each end. Call it **ten days of holidays**. Let's pretend he's run by corporations, and despite his pasty skin, they don't actually give a damn about anything except money, so we don't count that week.  Or go with Kwanzaa or Chanukah. It's a neutral ten days.

That leaves us twenty days or so to carve up 400 years. Easy math, that's 20 years per day, White History gets 340 divided by 20, or **seventeen days**. Black History gets **three days**. Isn't that much better? No more Black History Month, now there are just three Black History days. And Whites get almost six times as much as Blacks. 

To recap: **Eleven Paleo-Indian/First Nations History Months. Seventeen White History Days. Three Black History Days. And Ten Neutral Holiday Days.** Whee!

And all I ask is this:

If you object to Black History month on account of not giving equal attention to other cultural groups, then support all of my proposal, including investing as much of their time and children's education in the eleven Paleo-Indian/First Nations History Months that they do in their seventeen White History Days.

That's fair, isn't it?
