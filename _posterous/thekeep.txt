## The Keep

Once upon a time, there was an agrarian society. It founded a village by a river and built a mill for processing grain. The town built bakeries and a market. Things were feudal in those days, so there were nobles and commoners. The nobles lived in a big house on a nearby knoll, while the commoners lived in the village. Amusingly, the nobles used the words "villains" for the commoners, but that is beside the point of this story. The nobles made the important decisions, and the townspeople carried out their wishes.

The times being what they were, small wars sprung up, maybe it was something to do with the colour of the flowers the nobles grew in their garden. To protect themselves, the nobles walled the village and built a keep for their own residence. In those times, wars were conducted by nobles against other nobles, with the townspeople trampled underfoot.

When things grew peaceful again, the nobles started investing in upgrades for the keep. It had running water, an infirmary, central heating, exercise rooms, music rooms, and schoolrooms for educating their children. The walled village had become a town, but it lacked proper sewers and many of the other amenities of the keep. Mind you, the townsfolk had ready access to goods and jobs working in its services such as the smithy, the mill, and the bakery.

Life in the keep was, by our modern standards, nicer than life in the town which was, by our modern standards, nicer still than life outside. All continued in this way for some little time. Nobles running the show from within the keep, townspeople in the town, and rural folks outside.Then something happened. We aren't quite sure whether it was a sudden dramatic change or whether it happened gradually over several generations, but a schism grew within the nobility.

**A town in crisis**

Some of the nobility, the traditionalists, were happy with things being as they were. The town had prospered under the existing system, it had protected itself in the wars of the past, why change things? Others, the egalitarians, felt that there was something wrong with a system that kept all the townspeople out in the town and denied them the opportunity to live in the keep and to do the work of the nobles in the keep.

(None of the nobles knew what the townspeople thought about all this, because nobody asked them, not even the egalitarians, who were far too busy listening to themselves talk to listen to anyone else.)

There were many arguments about the social order. Some egalitarians argued that the nobles and the townspeople would benefit if bright townspeople were educated and could assist with the running of the town. This would build the town's prosperity as the country became more mercantile and free up knights for protecting the town's wealth. Other egalitarians suggested this was a moral issue, not a practical issue, and that everyone ought to have the same rights to the same lifestyle regardless of whether it was a benefit to the town's wealth or not.

The arguments were exhilarating at first but quickly became mired down in factionalism and emotional rhetoric. Nobody seemed to come up with any new arguments, so they just kept repeating the old ones in the vain hope that the fifty-sixth time would do the trick. After a while they fell to fighting amongst themselves, and the town went into a decline of sorts.

Things were looking bleak until emissaries were sent to King Rögnvaldr to settle the dispute. Rögnvaldr was busy fighting his half-brother for control of the kingdom and was most displeased that the city was weakened by infighting at a time when there was a real need for stability and strength.

Although somewhat inclined to the traditional view by nature, the King needed more knights and men-at-arms, and he saw that raising townspeople up by their bootstraps would help: Every townsperson helping to run the town freed a knight to join him on the battlefield.

**King Rögnvaldr's Decrees**

The King sent his decision by fast horseman back to the nobility:

First, Rögnvaldr decreed that any fit and obviously intelligent townsperson be admitted to the keep for training. Should they prove their aptitude, they were to be given work commensurate with their capabilities without preference or discrimination based on their origin. Nobility that undermined this through word or deed or innuendo or otherwise discouraging townspeople would be treated harshly.

Second, Rögnvaldr decreed that although one might "raise the portcullis," as it were, many townspeople would fear to enter. The first ones in would always have a heavy burden to work in a hitherto strange and forbidding environment, cut off from their peers and society. There would even be prejudices from other townspeople who would meanly vilify those that entered the keep as being "uppity" and "trying to act noble."

To counteract this natural pressure, the nobility were required to actively recruit promising townspeople to come into the keep, to "sell" them on it, as it were. No special preference need be given to those not qualified to do noble work, just an active effort to seek out those who were qualified and make it clear that they would not just be tolerated, but made welcome.

After that, if there were townspeople who chose to remain in the town, so be it. But the King made it clear that it was not sufficient to make a half-hearted effort to raise the portcullis and then complain that the schoolrooms were empty of the town's children.

Although the morality of opportunity is an interesting debate the first few times you hear it, the results of recruiting townspeople to do the work formerly reserved for the nobility is what would make the town strong in a time when peril threatened. And indeed, the town grew strong and prospered for many years, until someone invented the messageboard. But that, my friends, is another story for another day.
