Yes, [this shit](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/12/WebsThePlace) still happens. And yes, [people fall for it](https://www.iflowreader.com/Closing.aspx).

I'm not telling you to avoid developing software for proprietary platforms. But when you do, go in with your eyes open and accept that it's a gamble, a little like [guerilla gardening](http://www.guerrillagardening.org/). If it doesn't work out, throw the lottery ticket away and try something else.

I suppose it's too much to ask for people to accept the consequences with stoicism: It's human nature to complain---loudly---about being hard done by and how unfair a corporation is to act in their shareholder's best interests. Perhaps they hope that all the caterwauling will create change. Or maybe it's an attempt to get revenge: If they can't make money, maybe they can persuade a bunch of other people to abandon the platform and that'll teach the overlords not to mess with their vassals!
