## Interview Fail or Feature?

I read an interesting [blog post](http://michalbe.blogspot.com/2011/01/most-useless-skills-ever-aka-how-to.html) suggesting that being asked to re-implement Math.sqrt in a Javascript job interview is a WTF. I have to agree that nearly all of the time, it is. But keeping a very open mind, there is a difference between:

> Write a good implementation of Math.sqrt in Javascript because it's an approximation of what you will do working here. We'll fail you if we don't like your answer and plan to bombard you with questions about its memory footprint, performance characteristics, and most especially argue with your code formatting choices.

And:

> In the strictly hypothetical case that you had to write your own Math.sqrt in Javascript, walk us through your thinking so we can get an idea of how you approach programming. Obviously we don't re-invent the wheel here, but we wanted a small problem that everybody understands fairly well.

Math.sqrt isn't [my favourite interview question](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2006/06/my-favourite-interview-question.html), but to a certain extent the exact choice isn't the key. The key is the motivation behind the question. I'm very okay with a [FizzBuzz](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/01/dont-overthink-fizzbuzz.html) to weed out the charlatans that can talk a good game but can't code anything, no matter how simple. The key is to stop as soon as you have a green or red light, and not to make ridiculous assumptions about how a candidate would write production code based on an incredibly artificial problem in an interview.

Likewise, I'm very okay with using almost anything as "An excuse to have a conversation." If you want to ask about Monopoly, great. If you want to ask about how I would implement Math.sqrt using MapReduce, or to design a social networking site for kids learning arithmetic, or whatever, that's also great. I can live with coding a copy of Math.sqrt to kick the process off.

It all comes down to intent. If the intent is to explore in a positive manner, I'm game and interested. Ask me anything you like.
