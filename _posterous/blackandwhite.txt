## Black and White

From Joel Spolsky's [Camels and Rubber Duckies](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html):

> Software is priced three ways: free, cheap, and dear.
> 
>  • Free. Open source, etc. Not relevant to the current discussion. Nothing to see here. Move along.
> 
>  • Cheap. $10 - $1,000, sold to a very large number of people at a low price without a salesforce. Most shrinkwrapped consumer and small business software falls into this category.
> 
>  • Dear. $75,000 - $1,000,000, sold to a handful of rich big companies using a team of slick salespeople that do six months of intense PowerPoint just to get one goddamn sale. The Oracle model.
> 
> All three methods work fine.
> 
> Notice the gap? There's no software priced between $1,000 and $75,000. I'll tell you why. The minute you charge more than $1,000 you need to get serious corporate signoffs. You need a line item in their budget. You need purchasing managers and CEO approval and competitive bids and paperwork. So you need to send a salesperson out to the customer to do PowerPoint, with his airfare, golf course memberships, and $19.95 porn movies at the Ritz Carlton. And with all this, the cost of making one successful sale is going to average about $50,000. If you're sending salespeople out to customers and charging less than $75,000, you're losing money.
> 
> The joke of it is, big companies protect themselves so well against the risk of buying something expensive that they actually drive up the cost of the expensive stuff, from $1000 to $75000, which mostly goes towards the cost of jumping all the hurdles that they set up to insure that no purchase can possibly go wrong.

This has to be wrong. There must be dozens if not hundreds of companies selling software between $1,001 and $74,999. Sure, we can argue about whether that price is per seat, in which case the total site license is larger than $75,000, or per year, in which case the lifetime cost of the software might be greater than $75,000. But there must be _some_ software that costs more than a grand and less than seventy-five grand.

So Joel's wrong! Right‽

**George Boole died in 1864**

There are exceptions to the statement "There's no software priced between $1,000 and $75,000." Possibly large numbers of exceptions. But you know what? That's irrelevant to the basic point, which is not that there's absolutely no software priced between $1,000 and $75,000, but rather the insight that software pricing for businesses is driven by the customer's purchasing process, not by the cost to produce and support the software, or some mythical supply and demand model.

If it costs $50K to sell a certain package to a certain customer, you have to charge $75K or more to sell it, and your problem becomes what to put in the software such that those customers think it's worth $75K to them. That's what this quote says. The relative accuracy of that one sentence is irrelevant.

So?

Well, if you read Joel's words, you could very easily find yourself arguing whether he is "Wrong." I think it's important to shrug that argument off. In rhetoric, you look for stuff like this. "Aha!" you exclaim, "Mr. Speaker, I call your attention to Mr. Spolsky's claim of such-and-such. He is wrong, and this calls into question his entire argument." But reading and learning is not rhetoric. When reading, you win if you learn, not if you convince yourself that you know something the author does not know. If you shrug off the entire argument on the basis of an exception to one statement, what are you learning?

You don't want to go through life being one of those smug Internet people whose sole contribution to every discussion thread is "I stopped reading after..." 

Now, it's possible that Joel is wrong overall, that the "exceptions" to his pricing chasm are actually the rule. It's good to think this through, that helps us learn. So if you ask yourself about CAD software or site licenses for SQL Server or whatever that cost less than $75,000 site-wide, lifetime, you need to decide for yourself if these are rare, or heterogenous markets, or actually so common that Joel's overall point is incorrect.

Personally, my money's on heterogenous markets and rare. I think Joel is correct in general, and that the important insight is not "Never price your software between $1,000 and $75,000," but rather "Think very carefully about the cost of sales when you price your software."

p.s. Joel has [a much simpler explanation](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html) for statements like "There's no software priced between $1,000 and $75,000:"

> Please understand that I'm talking about large trends here, and therefore when I say things like "nobody" I really mean "fewer than 10,000,000 people," and so on and so forth.

p.p.s. Jerf nails it on Hacker News:

> It's an educational exercise to take something like Joel's essay, try to understand it in the way raganwald advocates here, and then go and edit it such that all the caveats, simplifications, etc are all explicitly enumerated. After you're done doubling the length, ask yourself if anybody would actually have read the end result. 
> 
> Having gone through a phase where I tried to write like that, I can tell you two things: First, "no". Second, it's a complete waste of time. Add in the caveat that you don't literally mean that there are 0 software packages sold in that price range, and you will still get flamed for the claim you just disclaimed. A lot of people are sloppy readers and putting in that level of detail is like putting fine detail in your painting for a farsighted person without their glasses. 
> 
> I've come to view this sort of misunderstanding as an unavoidable tax for trying to communicate with humans. I say "humans" because it's not "English's" fault. Natural language is fuzzy mostly because human ideation is fuzzy. Noticing when English creates fuzziness is a noteworthy event precisely because it is an anomaly in the vast sea of fundamentally fuzzy ideas being expressed in English.
