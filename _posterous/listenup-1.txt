## Listen Up!

I'm only going to say this once. I tried saying it [in allegorical form](http://raganwald.posterous.com/the-keep), now I'm going to write slowly and carefully. And toss in a metaphor.

**This is not about taking a conference with twenty white male speakers and trying to kick six of them out to make room for women, and then kicking another four out to make room for brown people**. This is about making the demand for that conference grow so that it would need forty speakers. This is about growing its audience, not shrinking the number of spots available to any one speaker demographic

It's about doubling the market for conferences. By doubling the number of people in our industry. By expanding every demographic.

**Everyone wants a meritocracy**. If you want to hire whoever you want based on merit, it's a win for you to have twice as many qualified applicants for each job opening. If you want to put on a conference, it's a win to have twice as many attendees that are interested in the content your curated group of speakers are going to deliver. And if you're a speaker, you win if there are twice as many conferences to choose from, and each one has twice the budget.

We aren't trying to carve up a fixed piece of pie, we're trying to **bake more pie** by bringing in more bakers and more hungry pie eaters.

Ok?
