## Freedom of Speech

Freeversation Â ([http://freeversation.com/about/](http://freeversation.com/about/)) is a new kind of forum for "responsible" anonymous conversation. The deal is that you can start what amounts to a private online chat, and invite people to it. Everyone can see who's in the conversation, but nobody knows who's saying what. It's the electronic equivalent of holding a conversation in the dark.

This is useful when you want to hold a conversation with some known folks, and you (a) want some comfort that what is being said is being discussed by the folks in the group, but (b) you want plausible deniability about the specific things being said.

So when management brings in consultants to restructure the company, you can talk to your trusted colleagues about the situation, while feeling safe that if somebody rats the group out, there won't be anything that HR can use to dismiss you with cause. "Hey," you can plead, "I was invited but I said nothing. I didn't even read the transcripts!"

The biggest problem with this is that your personal writing style is, well, personal. It's usually easy to infer who said what. That may not be enough for a legal case, but it's enough to make many people wary of allegedly anonymous channels such as an HR suggestion inbox or those hideous "surveys" that HR consulting forms pass around where you not only are expected to tell them what you really think, but you're supposed to handle the paper with your fingers and write out your thoughts in your own handwriting.

One way around this is to find someone to rewrite your words in their style. For example, you could send me an email, explain why it's important that you sway what needs to be said, and I can rewrite it in my verbose and well-known style. What's HR going to do when they figure out I wrote it, hire me so they can fire me?

Some of you clever folks might decide this can be crowd-sourced. Imagine a site where you perform rewrites for people. There are source texts and rewrites. Perhaps the site is clever and parcels things out on a paragraph by paragraph basis. If you write a one page suggestion for how to fix your company, you might sign in to find various independent translations for the paragraphs and you can mix and match. It could be that nobody sees more than a paragraph. Perhaps no one person can ever see all of the sources, just a random selection.

Food for thought.

p.s. Until such a site exists, if you desperately need to say something work-related, you can try asking me: [reg@braythwayt.com](mailto:reg@braythwayt.com). If I can help, I will. Obviously, this offer comes with no warranty and is subject to my capricious whims. And although I might sympathize with your situation, if it is political, economic, personal, or otherwise not an employer-employee thing, I am sorry but I cannot help you.
