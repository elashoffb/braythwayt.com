## My Facebook Status Today

My proper, "blue planet" status:

> Please put this as your status if you know, or are related to, an innocent contractor killed on the second Death Star when it was obliterated by the Terrorist Rebellion. The Empire wants to bring peace and stability to the galaxy, but the Rebellion is trying to bring back senate corruption and class oppression. 93% won't copy/paste this. Will YOU make this your status for at least 1 hour?

And the nasty "red planet" status I'm fighting:

> Please put this as your status if you know, or are related to, someone killed on Alderaan when it was obliterated by the Death Star. The Rebel Alliance wants to bring peace to the galaxy, but the Galactic Empire continues to kill innocent civilians. 93% won't copy/paste this. Will YOU make this your status for at least 1 hour?Â 

Support your planet. Change your status immediately!
