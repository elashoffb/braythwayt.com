## Acts of God

Up here in Canuckistan, we do have private insurance. If you drive, you must privately insure your automobile for libaility in Ontario. You need not insure it against theft. You can set your own deductible for damage. If you cannot afford to pay for automobile insurance, you do not drive. It's your choice. 

One might ask, why do we think that private automobile insurance works, but insist on government health insurance?

The answer is best illustrated by looking at Acts of God. Specifically, floods. I personally can buy flood insurance, but that's only because I'm far enough from any waterways or rivers that the likelihood of my home being carried away by a wave is practically nil. 

Whereas, people living on a flood plain (like the entire city of Winnipeg) can't buy flood insurance at any price. They're such high risk, that no actuary will quote them a reasonable price. Private insurers are unapologetic about this: The prevailing thought is, when nature strikes, the government must bail people out. 

This actually makes sense, because the "free market" doesn't work properly when it comes to flood plains. In theory, people would never put their homes on a flood plain if they couldn't get flood insurance. But the market for dwellings is highly irrational. People like in Winnipeg because other people live in Winnipeg. There is historical inertia. Jobs. A wonderful symphony where my brother is the first Tuba. A vibrant arts scene. 

If there was affordable flood insurance available to all, the folks in Winnipeg would all buy it and nobody else would buy it. That's the other side of the flood insurance problem: Although it's hard to move out of a flood plain, it's easy to know that you live in a flood plain. Inefficient access to ways to mitigate the risk plus efficient information about the risk leads to a broken market for insurance.

Flood insurance is nothing at all like automobile insurance.

They only way to get flood insurance premiums down to a reasonable level would be to make everyone buy it whether they need it or not. There's a word for making everyone buy insurance, and that word is spelled T-A-X-A-T-I-O-N. So the province of Manitoba and the Government of Canada take care of bailing folks out when the river floods, and we all pay our taxes to make it happen. 

So it comes to this: Private insurance doesn't work for floods because it's difficult to mitigate the risk, the information about whether people need the insurance is efficient, and given those two facts, allowing people to choose whether they pay for insurance leads to insanely high premiums and people who are uncovered because they can't or won't move away.

**Private Health Insurance Doesn't Work**

And so it is for Health Insurance. It has the same characteristics: The information about whether you need insurance is getting more and more efficient every day. If you're sick, you need it. If you have a history of anything, you need it. But it's very difficult to un-need it. In theory, expensive health insurance would get people to be lead healthy lives or some such.

But for whatever reason--maybe it's the nice people who make unhealthy snacks spending billions of dollars a year on advertising, or our weak wills, or both--people find it almost impossible to "move out of the high-risk area. That's certainly true of getting older, for example, you can't just decide to be 18 again and pay lower premiums. 

We know this up here in Canada, so we simply force everyone to buy health insurance and amortize the cost of health care across the entire population, whether you are high risk or not. If we left it to the private sector, the people who need the care would buy it, they people who don't need the care or couldn't afford it wouldn't, and the insurers would find ways to refuse to insure anyone living in the equivalent of a flood plain.

Difficulty of mitigating the risk plus ease of information about the risk equals the impossibility of fashioning a working system where people and/or insurers have any choice about participation. It's that simple.

**Prayer**

There's a codger, he lives alone, and one spring the river dams up with ice. The radio stations broadcast an alert: "Evacuate, the river is going to flood." He sets his jaw. "I'm a God-fearing man, righteous and true, Prayer will protect me, so that's what I'll do." 

Well, the river goes over its banks and floods his street. He goes up to the second floor of his house and is praying when the police come down the street in a motor launch. They're rescuing anyone who didn't get out on foot. "He waves them away, refusing to leave. "I'm a God-fearing man, righteous and true, Prayer will protect me, so that's what I'll do." 

Well, his house lifts off the foundation and floats out into the middle of the river, where it sinks. He jumps onto an ice floe and kneels in prayer. A news helicopter comes by, spots him, and with exceptional skill, gets low enough for him to grab a skid and climb aboard. He waves them off too. "I'm a God-fearing man, righteous and true, Prayer will protect me, so that's what I'll do." 

Nothing lasts forever, and the water overwhelms the ice dam. In the rush, his ice floe tips him into the maelstrom. He dies of hypothermia before he can drown. Naturally, he rises to heaven and St. Peter greets him warmly. "Faithful man, come right into heaven. But why the sour face?" Our codger is nothappy. "St. Peter, I am loathe to complain, but I kept my faith and prayed to be saved, yet God allowed me to die in that river!" 

St. Peter frowns. He looks in his big book. "It says here God sent you a radio broadcast, a police launch, and a helicopter. What other answer did you expect from your prayers?"
