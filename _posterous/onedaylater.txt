## One day later

One day after posting [Suicide?](http://raganwald.posterous.com/suicide) here on my non-code blog, it has nearly 100 tweets, has spent nearly twenty-four straight hours on the front page of Hacker News, and has generated [more than 200 comments](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3348671) there. (I was surprised to see it posted there and even more suprised at the interest.) I've also received some private emails, all of which have touched me. 

Some of the feedback has been negative. This is understandable. I would like to respond by stating something that will be obvious to you: People are unique. No two depressed people are in the same stage of depression. No two depressed people are depressed in exactly the same way. Some have said that this advice struck a chord with them. Some felt the opposite, expressing frustration or even anger. Some felt I have been there and understand them. Some felt I was throwing inauthentic pseudo-feelings on a web page.

> I never sought help because I didn't know what I was feeling could "count as" depression. Everyone describes it as darkness and sadness etc., none of which applied to my suicidal thoughts, so it just felt even more like nobody could _ever_ understand.  I wrote more about this at [http://da-softglow.blogspot.com/2011/09/national-suicide-prevention-week-story.html](http://da-softglow.blogspot.com/2011/09/national-suicide-prevention-week-story.html)

Some feel this advice wouldn't get people to seek help. Some felt that it would. Some---including someone close to me---have sought that type of help in the past and it didn't help them. Others told me that such help had saved them. Some cautioned that such talk could even trigger deeper depression and/or provoke someone to take their own life. Some felt that raising the subject was a benefit. Some felt I was misguided but accidentally doing good by acting as a catalyst for sharing views. Others felt that the subject shouldn't be raised at all, raising the subject of journalistic "standards" about reporting suicides.

My own feelings are extremely complex. I do not wish to write a long post spouting theories based on my own experience, anecdotes, and whatever books that I have read during periods where my mind was receptive to new ideas. I will simply say that there are very many different people with different experiences, and that any static post or approach is going to appeal to some, fall on deaf ears with others, and repel others.

If you felt that the post was wonderful, that it spoke to you and resonated with your experience, please try to understand that someone else may have had a different reaction, and that their feelings and perspectives are as valid as your own.

For my part, I have been touching on the subject of happiness from time to time since I started blogging in 2004. I try to approach it in many different ways, in part because my own feelings are far too complex to sum up in an essay, and in part because there are so many readers with so many perspectives, and no one essay or post is going to resonate with everyone who is open to ideas that could help them change themselves. If you feel I missed the mark, it could be that this time I was aiming elsewhere, but digging through my other writings you'll discover that I have shared part of your journey as well.

I write different things, and hope that this one will reach these people over here, and that one will help those people over there, and I hope that all of them will help me too. Writing is therapy for me.

I'll close by saying that I hope those of you who didn't like it or felt it was harmful or felt I was tossing out a sanitized and safe appeal will forgive me for not speaking to your personal experience. I never intended to suggest that there was a one-size-fits-all set of feelings, a one-size-all set of needs, or a one-size-fits-all road out of the darkness.

You matter to me, and by  that I mean you personally with your unique experience. I wish you well.
