## raganwald is civil so we are civil

Actually, no.

That isn't the reason we are (or should be) civil. And it isn't true for any value of "raganwald," including Paul Graham and Yukihiro Matsumoto. Here's the thing: The Internet encourages us to be rude. People can try gaming the system to encourage polite discourse and productive conversations, but for a variety of reasons every single venue for online discussion becomes infested with trolls.

And they aren't just infected with rudeness, they're carriers: They make everyone around them rude. We could ban them, we can plonk them, we can ignore them, but ultimately, everyone gets the message that it's okay to be rude. We have _permission_Â to be rude. And if we want points, karma, upvotes, attention, Reddit Gold, or whatever, the system is highly stacked towards scoring off people with populist soundbites.

Whether it's quoting Ayn Rand or being the next [ShitRedditSays](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/) star, some articulate mansplaining will get you further with the unruly crowd than reasoned musing. So. Why be civil? Why try to be productive? Why should you be the signal you want to see in the world?

It's very simple: **It's good practice for the real world**.

In the Real World, there are consequences for rudeness. And yet, the same dynamics exist in the real world. Startups have multiple people with strong personalities arguing how to proceed. A dinner party with your date's parents can easily present conflicting viewpoints about society, gun laws, race, and behaviour.

For most of our lives, we go further if we learn how to have a strong opinion, yet be able to discuss it productively with other people who hold opposing viewpoints. Being rude is rarely the optimum strategy. So what is our plan? Be rude online, but switch gears when we start a new job and someone is reviewing our first code checkin?

In every field of endeavour, we practice and train for top performance. We practice in flight simulators where we face improbable failures. We scrimmage to practice for game day. We lift weights and run to strengthen our bodies. We practice skills on our bikes, so they're second nature on the trail.

It's the same with our communication skills. It's harder to be civil on the Internet than in real life, and we encounter far more trolls and blithering idiots there. And that's exactly why we should be civil and constructive. If we can be civil here, we can be civil anywhere. If we can handle someone arguing about our semicolons on Reddit, we can handle someone making a constructive suggestion about software architecture in the office.

If you encounter someone dense, think of them as progressive resistance, like a plate being added to the bar. Take pride in being productive when provoked, just as you would take pride in throwing a perfect pass when being hurried in the pocket.

So be civil. Not for me. But for yourself.
