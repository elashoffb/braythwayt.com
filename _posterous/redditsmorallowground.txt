## Reddit's Moral Low Ground

In [one of the smarmiest moves in business history](http://deadspin.com/5952466/nike-dumps-lance-armstrong-in-the-smarmiest-way-possible), Nike wrung its hands and whined that Lance Armstrong misled them for a decade. Not mentioned in their press release: The billions of dollars they made sponsoring him while they looked the other way in the face of allegations of cheating. Not mentioned: The allegations that they themselves are connected with bribing an official to pervert the course of drug testing Mr. Armstrong.

Nike took the money, and now they're ducking the consequences.

**What about Reddit?**

> When I say "Reddit," I am not speaking of the "community" or the volunteer moderators, just the for-profit enterprise and the people who punch a clock every day in the pursuit of lucre. When I say "their," I am speaking of the company and/or its managers, people who make decisions in the pursuit of a paycheque.

One of Reddit's most controversial moderators was interviewed by a journalist. In the [article](http://gawker.com/5950981/unmasking-reddits-violentacrez-the-biggest-troll-on-the-web), his real name and other details---all gleaned from the Internet without subterfuge or lawbreaking---were revealed, breaking the pseudo-anonymity he enjoyed on Reddit itself. It seems that although Reddit encourages a culture of pseudo-anonymity within their site, they cannot be held responsible for what happens elsewhere.

Such is this man's controversy that he lost his job and is now seeking employment within the adult content industry. Rumour has it that his wife desperately needs insurance coverage.

Why is Reddit like Nike? Well, they had no problem boasting of the page views their moderator generated when he was peddling despicable filth on their site. They had no problem cashing cheques from advertisers. Even now, they speak out of both sides of their mouth, mumbling about free speech while disavowing approval of the choices this man made to make them money.

Nike threw Mr. Armstrong under a bus, accusing him of "misleading" Nike. Now Reddit is trying to speak out of both sides of its mouth, defiantly [championing free speech while trying to distance itself from their former moderator's choices](http://imgur.com/7oWt3). 

Reddit does not have the moral high ground. If Reddit wants to take the moral high ground, it has two choices.

First, Reddit could agree with critics, issue a mea culpa, apologise, and donate the money it made from their pariah's subreddits to charity. It's ok to say, "after reflection, although we agree with freedom of speech on the Internet, every community has community standards, and this type of thing does not fit our community's standards."

There's another option that takes the moral high ground. Reddit could hire this unemployed person. He made them money. His notoriety drew traffic like flies to faeces. He's a competent guy, and claims that he had discussed employment with them before. This would be controversial, but Reddit could stick their jaw out and really champion freedom of speech. They don't have to support the things he used to do, they can decide they don't want more of that controversy. But they can "stand by their man" and walk the talk of freedom of speech. Give him a job, take a little of the heat. Is that too much to ask?

Right now, Reddit is doing neither. They're talking about freedom of speech, but the message I read is that they'll take the money if you want to use Reddit to say something controversial. But if there are consequences... You're on your own. There are two moral high grounds, one against what this man did and one that supports his right to do it.

Reddit, I'm sorry to say, has chosen to pitch its tent in the hypocritical valley between them.
