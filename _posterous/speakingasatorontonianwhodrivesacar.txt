## Speaking as a Torontonian who drives a car...

Dear Mayor Ford:

Streetcars get in my way. But not as much as fifty people crammed into forty separate cars on the road.

Hipsters and bike couriers weaving in and out of traffic piss me off. But they're less dangerous to me on a bike than behind the wheel of a car.

Bike lanes take up valuable asphalt that could be devoted to cars. But if they encourage people to ride downtown and leave their cars at home, I have a better chance of finding a parking spot when I choose to drive.

So, speaking as a Torontonian who drives a car, I ask you to please follow through on your campaign promises to make Toronto a better place for car drivers like me:** Support the TTC and expand the bike lanes**. The more people take the better way or ride a bike, the less congestion we will have on the road, and the easier it will be for drivers like me. 

Thank you.

p.s. Speaking as a tax-payer, I suspect that a bike lane is also much cheaper than expanding a road to accomodate more cars and buses. Am I right?
