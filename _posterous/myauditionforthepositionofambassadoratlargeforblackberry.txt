Reg Braithwaite:

> "You know, people often ask me how to compare our new models to some of the products that people are already using. They ask me what we've learned from them, as you did. That's great. And yes, we did learn from them. Not so much about manufacturing, or how to make portable, powerful device that is the hub of your day. We have been doing this for as long as we've been a company, that's in our DNA."

> "What I think we've learned from those other products is the importance of getting things right for the entire user experience, not just the core four or five things you do the most, the core things you do 80% or 90% of the time yu use your device. We've always had the very best messaging platform. We've always had the best security for business. We've always had the best devices for texting and emailing. We've always beewn th ebets device for the things that people do the most."

> "Now we are also committed to that same excellence in being the best device to browse the web. To being the best device to manage your digital wallet. To being the best device to navigate from where you were to where you want to be. And everying else you do when you're not communicating on your device. While taking another leap forward to be the very best device every created to exhange messages, voice or video with the people that are important to you on any platform, on any device."

> "We've learned a lot from the way those other companies do a great job on things that our customers used to tell us were not critical. The bar has been raised, and we think we are still the very best device for messaging plus we are now leapfrogging them to be the best in all the things people are doing with their devices, not just the core things they do the most."
