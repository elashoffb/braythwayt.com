## The Superbowl, a Nerds-Eye View.

Let's look at this thing dispassionately, shall we?

[![111212belichick](images/111212belichick_jpg_scaled_500.jpg)](http://getfile2.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/raganwald/PzhuVVqtvxJFJaL1WWa1ijEWh1QMQ3AhWBOzFOeBhNkKIrnkuP2yqoaBJfLA/111212belichick.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg)

Two teams of approximately 40 people who know what they're doing. 80,000 people who have no idea what's really going on screaming for blood. Rivalries based on the colour of a bike shed, or if no bike shed is available, the colour of a helmet. Teams of has-beens and never-was's with vapid analysis and link-bait cliché sloganeering. The kind of off-topic pedantry and rules interpretation that would make a supreme court justice blush. Four and a half hours of talk about eleven minutes of content makes for a signal-to-noise ratio that's vanishingly small. When it's all over, nothing of importance has changed. Sounds like a Hacker News or Reddit thread to me!

Explain it again: Why don't nerds *love* this thing?
