## Suicide?

Horrible topic, but people often feel depressed over the holidays and wonder whether to end it all. Many do. If you are feeling depressed, there is help available. You may feel like you are alone and nobody is as bad a person as you are, or is as hard done by as you are, and you are right that you are unique and special and feel bad in unique and special ways. But you are not unique in feeling alone and hurting and feeling that life is not worth it.

If you are feeling disconnected from others, if you feel isolated even when people are around you trying to help, you are not alone, others have felt alone and apart just like you. There is a way back, there is a way to connect with people again.

Others have felt what you are feeling and have gotten through it with help. You can get help too. You can get through it, you can be happy again. 

If you are contemplating suicide, do not feel embarassed. Do not feel you will be branded for the rest of your life. Do not fear being shamed. Simply call 1-800-273-TALK (8255). In Canada 1-800-448-1833. In the UK dial 08457 90 90 90. In the Republic of Ireland dial 1850 60 90 90. In [Australia](http://www.lifeline.org.au/), call 13 11 14. You will talk to someone. 

They will listen. I know you want to be heard. Let them hear you. Let them listen. Call them now.
