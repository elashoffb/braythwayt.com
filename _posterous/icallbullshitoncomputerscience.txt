## I call bullshit on Computer "Science"

From time to time I read claims about programmer "productivity," such as claims that Ruby is more productive than Assembler, or the best programmers are 20 times or 100 times or even 1000 times more productive than the worst ones, or claims that Pair Programming is more productive than solo programming, or claims that solo programming is more productive than pair programming, or two monitors are more productive than one, or Emacs vs. Vi, or index cards on a wall vs. Pivotal Tracker, or whatever opinion people have concerning what happens when one or more humans set out to create software.

I'**m calling bullshit on all claims about humans creating software. All of them. Every one. **  


Computer Science is a Formal Science, meaning it concerns itself with the study of formal systems, much as Mathematics does. Computer Science can definitively answer questions about the nature of uncomputable problems or the length of a program that produces a certain number. Computer Science is silent on the subject of humans creating software. If we were mathematicians, we would take a statement like "The best programmer is 1,000 times more productive than the worst programmer" and use rules to determine whether we can prove it to be true or false given the axioms of computer science's formal system. Not gonna happen, so forget about Computer Science answering questions about programming. 

There's more to Science than the study of Formal Systems, of course. There's a huge branch of Science that concerns itself with the study of actual, tangible reality. Such studies are called **Empirical Sciences**. The modus operandi of an Empirical Science is to make assertions that produce falsifiable predictions about the real world. In other words, if we are given the assertion that pair programming is more productive than solo programming, an empirical scientist wouldn't "prove" it given axioms about programming, he'd come up with a prediction that follows from the assertion such as "Given a task, two solo programmers can complete it more quickly than a pair programming team." He'd then go out and find a way to set up an experiment where you could unambiguously determine whether the results of the experiment matched the prediction. He'd share his results with his peers and they would audit his work. Some would attempt to repeat the test to ensure that its results were consistent.

Does this sound like what we do with respect to what we think we know about humans creating software? At all? Ever? I would like to meet the person who can can describe for me what it means for a statement like "Ruby is more productive than Assembler" and then contrive an experiment to confirm or invalidate the assertion. For starters, I would like to meet the person who can even _describe_ a repeatable and objective means for measuring a programmer's productivity.

Until that happens, I call bullshit on the expression "programmer productivity" and all other claims about what happens when humans set out to create software. I'm not saying we don't observe programmers and we don't have personal opinions--even widely held opinions--about which ones are productive, or what tools are superior to others, or why.

But let's be honest with each other. Until we start treating programming as an Empirical Science, what we have are superstitions and mass hallucinations. They might be comforting and somewhat consistent hallucinations, but when it comes to writing software, our beliefs are almost all equivalent to the belief that [waving palm fronds in the air will summon airplanes](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Cargo_cult_science).
