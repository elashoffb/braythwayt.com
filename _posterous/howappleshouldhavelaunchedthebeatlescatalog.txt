## How Apple Should Have Launched The Beatles' Catalog

I've just checked my inbox, and Steve Jobs has _never_ emailed telling me how to write software. Nevertheless, I have it in my head that he cares about the opinion of a lowly code scribe on the subject of running one of the best managed companies in the world. So here goes:

**How to launch The Beatles' Catalog in five easy steps**

  1. Send out invitations for a product announcement.
  2. Announce and demo iTunes in the cloud. All of your music, on all of your devices, all of the time. Synchronized. Integrated with Ping. Cool, wonderful, neat-o.
  3. Thank you very much, I've asked a friend to play some music for you. Paul McCartney walks out on stage and sits at a grand piano.
  4. "Oh, I almost forgot. One more thing!"
  5. Announce that the Beatles' Back Catalogue is on iTunes **now** and in the cloud **now**.
